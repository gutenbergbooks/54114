<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<hr class="r5m" />

<p class="roman">I.</p>

<h2>THE STORY IN PRIMARY INSTRUCTION.</h2>

<p>The greatest need of the primary school to-day is some positive
content or subject matter of instruction. The popular conception of
such a school is that its main function is to teach the young child to
read, write, and cipher. That is, that it has to do mainly with the
formal aspects of language and numbers. So long as a certain amount of
facility is gained in these formal arts, there is little disposition to
demand anything more.</p>

<p>Even so great an authority as the Committee of Fifteen has
championed this view, and has given as its deliberate judgment that the
first four years of school life should be devoted to the mastery of
the formal phases of instruction. While it may be contended that it is
not meant to exclude the giving of a positive subject matter, still it
is interpreted as sanctioning the present obvious over-emphasis of the
formal side of language in our primary schools.</p>

<p>A strict conformity to this formal program would mean that the
first four years of school life, the most impressionable<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> period in
the pupil&#8217;s school career, are to be empty of any real subject
matter. The mastery of written and printed forms is to be set up as an
end in itself, losing sight of the fact that they are but means for
conveying the thought, feelings, experiences, and aspirations of the
race from one generation to another.</p>

<p>When we consider what the child at the age of six or seven really
is; when we consider his love of story, his hunger for the concrete
material of knowledge, his deep interest in the widening of his
experience,&mdash;it is evident that such a course is out of all
harmony with his real nature. It is the giving of stones when the cry
is for bread. It is even worse than the proverbial making of bricks
without straw. It is attempting to make bricks with straw alone.</p>

<h3>THE MASTERY OF A VOCABULARY NOT THE MATERIAL OF INSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p>It will be granted that the mastery of a printed and a written
vocabulary is of the utmost importance. As a subordinate end, the
ability to interpret the printed page and to express thought in
correct form is the most imperative demand upon the school. But these
acquirements are not a content in themselves. They are not the material
of instruction. In themselves, they do not enlarge the understanding or
furnish the food which the young mind hungers for&mdash;and must<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> have if it
is maintained in a condition of health. They are mere forms, and the
dwelling upon them during the impressionable years of childhood results
in a deadening of his interest and dwarfing of his powers, so that the
over-emphasis of this phase of education to the exclusion of content
defeats its own ends.</p>

<p>Laying the foundation for a future character edifice, keeping active
the developing interests, the widening of his experience, the formation
of interpretative concepts,&mdash;these are of greater value from the
point of view of language mastery, even of its spoken and written
forms, than the persistent drill in its formal elements.</p>

<p>Language teaching must be approached from the content side if we
are to get any genuine interest in the overcoming of difficulties
on the part of the child. There is no interest for the child in the
language forms themselves when presented in abstraction and emphasized
as such. He may be drilled into proficiency, but the interest does
not come from the relation of these formal elements to his own
needs or activity. The interest has been external and it flags as
soon as the external excitement is withdrawn. A genuine interest,
an intrinsic one growing out of his own needs and nature, can be
fostered only by supplying a subject matter adapted to the various
levels of thought through which his development leads him. If this is
furnished, it is no partial, intermittent<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> attention that the pupil
gives. While dealing with such a content he is not forming the habit
of mind-wandering and inattention so frequently seen when children are
kept closely to word drill and to reading for elocutionary purposes.</p>

<h3>A WIDER CIRCLE AND PURPOSE, GROWING OUT OF THE CHILD&#8217;S LIFE
AND NEEDS.</h3>

<p>The possession of a wide acquaintance with the standard subject
matter of child literature before serious attempts at learning to read
are made, will subordinate the acquisition of a reading vocabulary as
means to an end desired on the part of the child. There will be purpose
in it for him. The learning to read will be seen as a step necessary to
a fuller expression of activities already going on, and difficulties
will be overcome because their mastery is a means in a wider circle of
purpose growing out of the child&#8217;s own life and needs. If, in
early years, the emphasis is removed from the form to the content side
of instruction, if his native hunger for folklore and nature-material
is satisfied, the learning to read will be lifted out of drudgery
and will be accomplished with self-effort, and with a rapidity truly
surprising.</p>

<p>The early forcing of technique is not a real gain in the
child&#8217;s education, however much may be apparently accomplished.
Immediate results are not a safe guide for instruction in the primary
grades. They are, many times, a positive loss<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> in time, and are gained at the
expense of dwarfing the mental and physical powers. There is no real
need of forcing the process of learning to read if the teacher is ready
with a subject matter which the child is already going out to meet.</p>

<p>The time of the first year of school life would conduce far more to
the child&#8217;s progress if spent with learning to read and write as
a secondary consideration, and the giving of a real body of culture,
ethical, and nature material as a main purpose. Subsequent progress
would be all the more rapid and instruction be all the more educative
because a wider range of interest would call forth self-active
participation of all the powers. The widening of experience and the
formation of interpretative concepts would allow further instruction
to be grasped with sufficient avidity to carry it over into actual
assimilation into the self.</p>

<h3>LANGUAGE TEACHING.</h3>

<p>What has been said with regard to the relation of reading to a
content is equally true with regard to what is known as language
teaching. It is a hopeless task to endeavor to give skill in the use
of language independent of a content which is not in accord with the
pupil&#8217;s own stage of development. The interest, to be genuine,
and productive of self-effort, must always be in the content. An
enrichment of his vocabulary, a proper use of words, correct form
of oral and written speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10"
id="Page_10">[10]</a></span> must come, not for themselves, but as
results of an effort to the adequate expression of something which the
pupil is interested to communicate.</p>

<p>The widespread criticism directed against the results of language
teaching in our schools no doubt has something of justification.
This defect does not come from lack of attention to the matter, or
from indifference on the part of the teachers, but largely from the
over-emphasis of the purely formal aspects of language. The matter is
approached from the wrong side. In early years, to get form we must
emphasize content. In the primary grades, formal insistence on correct
technique should be at the minimum, while richness and variety of
subject matter should be at the maximum.</p>

<p>Nor is this without application to the remaining forms of language
expression,&mdash;drawing and music. Skill in aesthetic forms can come
only from an interest in something to be expressed in these forms.</p>

<p>When we consider that the child, up to the eighth or ninth year
of his life, has not a sufficient mastery of a reading vocabulary
to enable him to get for himself out of books material for which he
has deepest need, and which is his natural and proper nourishment,
the imparting to him orally such material assumes an aspect of
gravest importance. Shall his early years of school life be barren
and empty? Surely the teacher has a duty in this respect beyond
giving merely formal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11"
id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> instruction. She should not allow the
pressure for immediate technical results to deprive the child of his
inheritance in the folklore and the epic treasures of the race.</p>

<p>It has been shown by experiment that, with young children,
instruction is taken more readily through the ear than through the eye.
Their pre-school education has been acquired largely through auditory
impressions and exists in the mind in the form of auditory images. To
throw the emphasis at once on visual impression and imagery is too
violent a break in their mental habits.</p>

<p class="roman2">II.</p>

<h2>THE SELECTION OF THE SUBJECT-MATTER.</h2>

<p>The kind of content proper to early childhood is determined by
the nature of the child himself. It is the child that is to be
educated. The teacher must take him as he is, with full trust that
the strengthening of those powers at present active will result
in his highest good. All attempts to improve on nature has been
abortive. Every normal child is active in those ways which the
race experience has embedded in him. His activities are echoes of
those by which the race has been successful. The conception of the
child standing over against the real subject matter of education
and in direct antagonism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12"
id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> to it, between which and him there is no
intrinsic relation and into which he must be introduced by external
means, is not in harmony with an optimistic philosophy or with a
correct understanding of pedagogical principles.</p>

<p>There must be, in the nature of things, a relation between the
activities already functioning in the child and the material the
assimilation of which will constitute him not only a thoroughly
equipped individual but also a socially efficient factor. It is a
mistaken view to suppose that the exercise and the development of the
activities dominant in early childhood will lead away from the best
interests of the individual or endanger his efficiency as a member of
society. It is anomalous to assume that the impulses and interests
of childhood must be suppressed or eradicated in order to fit him
for participation in social life. These impulses have been implanted
in his nature by actual participation in a social life on the part
of his ancestry, and they are the possibilities of a worthy social
development.</p>

<p>While this is true, while the determining factor in the selection
and arrangement of the subject-matter of education is the child
himself, yet the undoubted parallelism between his growth and that
of the race widens the scope and furnishes the broader basis for
such selection and arrangement. It matters little to what extent
such a parallelism is accepted. The principle once established makes
it a matter of indifference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13"
id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> whether we proceed from the individual or
from the broader standpoint of the psychological history of the race.
This psychological history is made out by a study of the literature
products left behind in the ascent from the lower levels of development
to the higher, as represented in modern civilization.</p>

<h3>PHASE OF MIND ACTIVITY IN EARLY CIVILIZATION.</h3>

<p>A survey of the literary remains of the past gives conclusive proof
that the characteristic phase of mind activity in the dawning periods
of civilization is the imaginative or mythical. The earliest literary
product of every people is the epic, whose chief elements are legends,
myths and the heroic, and whose authorship is not individual but of
the race itself. Such a product, not the creation of any one mind, but
slowly fashioned through the centuries by the poetic genius of the
race, however trivial it may seem, has strong claims on our deepest
veneration. It should receive most careful study and consideration.</p>

<p>These epic remains come from the innermost life of a people.
They are the expression of this life. They are eloquent witnesses
of a strong imagination dealing with the mysteries of earth, of
sky, and of life itself. They tell of the morning of history, when
man was close to nature&mdash;a part of nature. The earth, trees,
waters, animals&mdash;all forms, animate and inanimate,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> had
voices for him. He communed with them. He treated them as of equal rank
with himself.</p>

<h3>A THIRD ELEMENT OF THE RACE PRODUCTS.</h3>

<p>But, in addition to their imaginative character and their closeness
to nature, these race products have still a third element of the
utmost value for use as material for primary instruction. While they
&#8220;enforce no moral&#8221; they tell &#8220;a story, and the moral
in solution with the story.&#8221; Each tale is a narration without
comment. The ethical teaching involved is in the most concrete form.
It is not set out and emphasized, but lies wrapped up in the movement
of the narrative itself and awaits the exercise of the child&#8217;s
ethical judgment.</p>

<p>Viewed from our ethical standpoint, folklore does not always come
up to the highest standard. There are objectionable features in many
tales. In this respect they reflect the uncritical and even crude
morals of the time. While this is true of some of the tales, in many
the ethical teaching is pure, lofty and wholesome, and furnishes an
element greatly needed in our primary schools. We have here held up
for esteem and veneration these virtues of head and heart and action
that lie at the base of a happy, considerate and industrious home
life. Baseness, cruelty, ingratitude, and laziness are brought home
to the individual in their consequences. The corresponding<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> virtues
are shown in their true relation to happiness and well being. This may
not be the highest form of ethical activity, but it is the only kind
of ethical teaching on a level with child thought. The morality of the
stories is set forth in the concrete as a principle of action found
valuable in the race&#8217;s history.</p>

<p>That such a content is a great <i lang="la"
xml:lang="la">desideratum</i> for purposes of ethical instruction in our
schools all will admit. The condition of religious thought is such as
to preclude the use of sacred literature. Perhaps it would not afford
so many advantages for purposes of ethical teaching in the first year
of school life as literature closer to the childhood of the race in its
origin. Some subject-matter that affords opportunity for the exercise
of the ethical judgment is an imperative demand for our time. What is
there more suitable than this embalmed judgment of the race as to what
is valuable in conduct and character? Here are stored up in a form that
appeals to the child material for generalizations as to the conditions
of well-being and of happiness, as well as of a moral and a useful
life. All that the race has thought, felt, and experienced is here at
the service of the child. One is almost tempted to use the expression
of Hegel and say that, in assimilating the ethical teaching of these
racial literatures, the child is being suckled at the breast of the
Universal Ethos.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16"
id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE LEGENDARY AND THE MYTHOLOGICAL THE CHILD&#8217;S NATURAL
FOOD.</h3>

<p>Even to casual observation there is close correspondence between
child nature and the characteristics of the early literature of the
race. Children are wholly in the imaginative on mythical level of
thought. They are immersed in the sensuous. They refuse to be bound by
the hard matter of fact. They will away and claim the world as their
own through which to roam on the unfettered wing of fancy. They claim
freedom to construct their own world and to people it with creatures
of their own fabrication, independent of the shackles of time and
space.</p>

<p>The child also feels himself a part of nature, not as something
standing over against it. The separation has not yet come. He ascribes
an equal and like personality to animate and inanimate objects. He is
at home among animals and plants. There is spontaneous interest in all
phases of nature, and inborn love for her creatures; and as to the
ethical element, the child is not without points of contact for it. He
is born with social impulses. He is not only to be a social creature,
but is one at all stages of development. He is nothing if not social.
The fiction of original, independent individuality which must be thrown
off, given up, or eradicated before becoming a social being, is fast
giving way to the natural or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17"
id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> organic theories of social origin and
growth. The very impulses which are sometimes cited to show the natural
depravity of childhood are the vigorous reaching out of his nature
toward a participation in the social life.</p>

<p>Thus there can be little doubt as to the fitness of legendary and
mythological material for the needs of the child. It is his natural
food. It fits in with his forms of thought&mdash;is in obvious relation
to them. It meets the needs of activities already functioning. It
discloses a world in which he can be at home. It falls in with his
interpretation of this world, while the simple social life therein
depicted appeals to his interest.</p>

<h3>HOW ARE WE TO DISCRIMINATE AS TO MATERIAL TO BE SELECTED?</h3>

<p>If this position is granted, how then, out of the vast richness of
the material, are particular selections to be made? What principles
should govern in our choice? As already hinted there are degrees
of value, for purposes of instruction, in the immense treasury of
folklore, myth and fable. It will be readily conceded that what is
known as folklore has qualities rendering it of greatest value, for the
first years of school life. It is simple and direct. Its conception
of the world is that of pure naturalism. The formal myth and fable
belong to later stages of mental development. The fable, too, has
the objection of being explicitly didactic in its enforcement of the
moral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<h3>NARRATIVES SELECTED AND THE BASIS OF SELECTION.</h3>

<p>In the following narratives, for the most part consisting of German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">M&auml;rchen</i>, the principles of selection
given below have been kept in mind:</p>

<p>1. The story must be simple, direct, and imaginative.</p>

<p>2. It must have strong ethical significance and must avoid cruel
situations. Stories dealing with happy home life&mdash;emphasizing
industry, thrift, and usefulness&mdash;are to be given preference.</p>

<p>3. It must offer a content rich in social allusion, in outdoor life,
and in references to natural objects, animate and inanimate.</p>

<p>4. It should be of such abiding worth that it will bear repetition
and hold interest.</p>

<p>5. It must be dramatic; that is, there should be movement, activity,
dialogue, interesting and even humorous incidents, but all subordinate
to a central unity. Only such a dramatic unity can work a deep and
lasting impression.</p>

<p>These principles of selection are in the main those enunciated by
William Rein in his excellent manual, <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Erste Schuljahr</i>, a book
with which every primary teacher should be familiar. The stories here
presented have the sanction of such eminent students of pedagogy
as William Rein, Ziller,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> Just, and Hiemish&mdash;all leaders of
educational thought in Germany.</p>

<p>The text of the first fourteen tales has been translated with a
few adaptations from the German of Hiemish, as found in his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das
Gesinnungsunterricht</i>. To these have been added Andersen&#8217;s <cite>Fir
Tree</cite> and Miss Harrison&#8217;s <cite>Hans and the Four Big Giants</cite>.</p>

<p>The order here given is not essential, but on the whole it will
be found a rational one. The succession could be determined by many
points of view. The one here chosen is that of relation to home life.
The series begins with the simplest home relations of parents and
brother and sister. It gradually broadens into the wider circle of
companionship, and contact with the world external to the home. It
culminates in Miss Harrison&#8217;s fine story, <cite>Hans and the Four Big
Giants</cite>, where the separation from home is complete and the child is
brought into contact with the highest industrial and scientific phases
of modern civilization. Transition from the more simple situations to
the more complex and longer narratives have also been kept in mind.</p>

<h3>THE FOUR STORY GROUPS.</h3>

<p>Thus the stories fall into four groups. The First Group comprises
<cite>The Seven Little Goats</cite>, <cite>The Star Dollars</cite>, <cite>Red Riding Hood</cite>, <cite>Sweet
Rice Porridge</cite>, <cite>Mother Frost</cite>, and <cite>Rose-Red</cite><span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> <cite>and Snow-White</cite>. These
stories are confined chiefly to the home circle and deal with the
relation of parent and child.</p>

<p>The Second Group is <cite>The Cock and the Hen</cite>, <cite>The Death of the Cock</cite>,
and <cite>Birdie and Lena</cite>. These are partly inside and partly outside the
family circle. There is contact with persons outside the home.</p>

<p>The Third Group is <cite>The Wolf and the Fox</cite>, <cite>The Street Musicians</cite>,
<cite>The Straw</cite>, <cite>The Coal and the Bean</cite>, <cite>The Wonderful Traveler</cite>, and
<cite>Cinderella</cite>. This group extends the relationship further into the
external world.</p>

<p>Lastly, in the story of <cite>Hans and the Four Big Giants</cite>, the horizon
is widened so as to include the separation from the home and an
independent career among strangers. <cite>The Fir Tree</cite> is added for use as
a Christmas story for those who desire it. In fact, many of the stories
could be taken out of their order and be used as introductions to the
study of the seasons. The Cock and the Hen is an autumn story, while
several others might be used as dealing with spring time.</p>

<p class="roman2">III.</p>

<h2>THE PROBLEM OF CORRELATION.</h2>

<p>The two chief problems of educational practice concern the
selection and the arrangement or organization of the educative<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
material. The problem of the organization of the subject-matter is
spoken of as Correlation or Concentration. Any proposal silent on this
point would not be adequate to the best school thought or practice of
the hour.</p>

<p>The main contention over this question hinges on what subject
should be taken as a center around which other lines of instruction
should be gathered. Against the proposition to use the historical or
culture-historical material as such a center objections can easily be
raised. It will be granted that it does not offer an ideal point of
departure for all the activities of even the primary school. It will be
granted further that such a center is not the true center of the social
life. It is liable to over-emphasize the purely intellectual side of
instruction at the expense of the volitional phases, and it cannot be a
center for the correlation of number.</p>

<p>But mathematics and literature do not correlate. Arithmetic and
formal science have arisen in dealing with the practical problems of
industrial processes. They are forms which industrial processes have
taken on. There are some reasonable objections to the correlation of
what is called &#8220;Construction Work&#8221; with this literature
material.</p>

<p>But, on the whole, the narrative, or story, offers, under present
conditions, the only practicable center for correlation in the
first school year. Especially since, at this period, formal<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
number work and science proper are at their minimum. For the
language arts,&mdash;reading, writing, spelling, exercises in
oral speech,&mdash;it is the natural medium. The aesthetic
arts,&mdash;drawing and music&mdash;and even construction work, can be
correlated here without undue violence to instruction as an organic
unity. This material, too, furnishes at least a point of departure for
what is known as nature study. It will find abundant inspiration in the
animals, plants, and natural objects alluded to.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that the stories are to be
used as a medium of instruction, not just told and enjoyed. They are
to be regarded as subject-matter to be assimilated and expressed. They
provide a content by means of which the various school arts may reverse
their usual direction and become, so to speak, centrifugal&mdash;the
spontaneous outflowing of the self.</p>

<p>Merely telling the story does not exhaust its possibilities. It
should be made a means for the exercise of the entire round of childish
activities. Unless the understanding is enlarged, the sympathies
widened, the ethical sense deepened, and steady advance made in all
lines of technique, the teacher will miss the true aim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23"
id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p class="roman2">IV.</p>

<h2>SUGGESTIONS.</h2>

<p>The manner or method of presenting and using the material is based
largely on Herbart&#8217;s &#8220;Formal Steps.&#8221; Though an effort
has been made to get away from their rigidity, no teacher can afford
to become hampered by the requirements of a too rigid system or a too
formal method of instruction. Yet there must always be a consciousness
of what meets the demands of educative instruction. Apperception, or
learning, takes place under certain conditions only. These conditions
must be met.</p>

<h3>THE TREATMENT.</h3>

<p>It is not the intention to give a list of set questions whose form
and order are to be rigidly followed. It is difficult to fix upon the
precise point where such questions cease to be helpful and suggestive
and begin to trench on the legitimate province of the teacher. In order
to avoid this unpardonable sin, the treatment of some of the stories
has been elaborated quite fully, to show the work entire as it has been
given to children; while that of others has been outlined, noting only
the main points to be brought out and leaving the form of presentation
largely to the teacher&#8217;s individuality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24"
id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing can take the place of originality and spontaneity. If a
fixed program is followed, the main purpose of the work will be missed
and the interest for both teacher and children will evaporate. In the
treatment of the two elements, the ethical and the nature material have
been separated from each other and from the other parts. This is for
the purpose of emphasizing them in the teacher&#8217;s mind. The plan
need not be followed in the actual work. Questions and explanations may
be introduced into the narration if care be taken that the interruption
does not break the thread of the story.</p>

<p>There has been no attempt to divide the subject into lessons.
However, the preparation, the narration, and the deepening should, in
most cases, be all that is undertaken in one period of fifteen minutes.
This is as long as young children should be kept to one exercise. If
this is done in the morning session, the reproduction and the other
exercises could come in the afternoon session.</p>

<h3>REPRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>A child learns to talk fluently and with correctness by talking.
Oral speech should come before written speech. If the pupil can talk
in good English with ease there will not be much trouble with written
expression. To this end there should be much time given to oral
reproduction by the children.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25"
id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> Even the most backward child should be
encouraged to attempt it. There will be a strong temptation to allow
the brilliant story tellers to do most of the reproducing. Each child
should be thrown wholly on his own responsibility. Let him tell what he
can in his own way and reserve corrections until he is done. The story
itself should be kept fluid. It should not be allowed to crystallize
into set phrases on the part of either teacher or children. Great
liberty should be allowed in reproduction, so that freshness and
spontaneity may never be lacking. The reproduction may immediately
follow the deepening process or be reserved for a separate period. It
should be given from the beginning frequently.</p>

<h3>THE PREPARATION.</h3>

<p>It is well to give the aim or purpose of the story first. This may
be in the form of a brief outline giving the general direction which
the story is to take. Some such hint seems a pedagogical necessity.
Nothing is so tiresome to an adult, even, as to listen to a discourse
whose aim and purpose are not apparent. And then the movement as a
whole should be in the mind of the children from the first.</p>

<p>It is in accordance with sound pedagogy to bring to the foreground
of consciousness the ideas already possessed by the children, and known
to be related to what is to be presented.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> The new is learned
or understood (apperceived) by the old. That which has been once
assimilated enters into and modifies old concepts; these in turn
classify the new material and reduce it to order and unity. It is
therefore important that, before a story is told, the related ideas
be brought forward ready for use by means of a few well directed
questions. In many cases the proper result may be attained by
suggesting a difficulty or problem for the children to solve.</p>

<h3>THE NARRATION.</h3>

<p>After the preparation follows the story. It should be given in short
divisions. Each such division should be as far as possible a dramatic
unity, subordinate of course to the main one.</p>

<p>The story should be told, not read. Every primary teacher should
be a story teller. Anyone that has felt the deep, enthusiastic
response of children to a story well told will feel amply repaid for
any effort to cultivate the art of story telling. On this point few
suggestions can be given. The main elements of good story telling are
intrinsically connected with the emotional and spiritual endowments. A
genuine appreciation of child-nature must be combined with a lively and
emotional manner of expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27"
id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE DEEPENING.</h3>

<p>It is wise in most cases to question on the main points of the
narration. This fixes them in the children&#8217;s minds so that
reproduction of the story will more readily follow. The amount of such
questioning must be determined by the needs of the class. Only the main
points should be dwelt upon. With young children details should be
avoided.</p>

<h3>THE NATURE-MATERIAL.</h3>

<p>The best way to widen the experience of children is to bring them
into actual contact with things. But, as organized and carried on at
present, the school can do very little of this first-hand teaching.
However, at school age, such is the activity of childhood, most
children have a considerable body of nature experience which can
be used as interpretative concepts for new and similar material.
Careful teaching will always aim to discover what experience the
individual members of a class have had in order that inadequate ideas
may be strengthened and given greater detail. This may be done by
some child&#8217;s telling his experience, by the teacher giving the
information&mdash;using descriptions, pictures or drawings,&mdash;or
finally by proper questioning.</p>

<p>Starting from what is already known, a skillful teacher can build
up an idea, though of course more or less indefinite, of<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> the
object or process that is comparatively unknown. Questioning can never
do more than bring into explicitness what is really in the mind in a
vague way. Yet, when we consider that the possibilities of all science
and, in fact, of all knowledge, are implicit in the experiences of the
normal child of school age, it is seen that the use of questions as
an educative means is practically unlimited and that it should not be
neglected even in the primary grades.</p>

<p>There is in the stories an abundance of nature-material and of
material bearing on industrial occupations and processes that may
serve, when properly used, as an excellent basis for mental growth
in these directions. In making sure that ideas along these lines
are clear, a foundation is being laid for a more vital grasping of
geographical instruction later on.</p>

<p>The old object-lesson was an effort in this direction, but its
formality and isolation killed it. It is not the purpose to recommend
formal object lessons. The main purpose should be to see that the
allusions to natural objects and to industrial occupations and
processes are understood. And if they are not, to bring them into
adequate clearness by proper instruction.</p>

<h3>THE ETHICAL MATERIAL.</h3>

<p>There is a wide difference, so far as method is concerned,
between setting forth the moral to a tale in an explicit way<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> and
allowing children to express their judgments upon concrete facts of
conduct. The latter is all that should be attempted. In the reaction
from formal moral instruction there is danger of going to the other
extreme and neglecting it entirely.</p>

<p>The vital element in literature&mdash;its ultimate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison
d&#8217;etre</i>&mdash;is its ethical import. It constitutes the ethical
medium. It gives each child the benefit of the experience of the race.
The duty of the school to give occasion for the exercise of ethical
judgments is greater than its duty to train the merely intellectual
judgment. For the one determines what is good or bad, the other what
is real or unreal. Right conduct is of more importance than mere
knowing.</p>

<h3>READING.</h3>

<p>The teaching of the mechanics of reading concerns itself with
affixing visual images of words to the auditory vocabulary already
possessed by the child. As this is a purely formal process, having
little educative value in itself, the judicious teacher will welcome
any suggestion toward minimizing routine drill. Instead of attempting
to fix the visual form of each word, she will limit the formal
instruction to giving the child a capability of deciphering new
words for himself, that is, of translating them into motor images of
articulation. Instruction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30"
id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> that does not give to the child this
capability is wasting time and misdirecting energy.</p>

<p>In order to have facility in the mastering of new words, it is
necessary that there be a knowledge of the vocal value of the letters
and an acquaintance with the groups into which words may be separated
according to similarity of sound. Thus daily short drills upon the
purely formal side seems a necessity. This should be done in a separate
exercise, however.</p>

<p>At the same time this formal process should not be wholly divorced
from the thought side. The learner should be able to grasp quickly
the meaning the sentence conveys as a whole, and to give it natural
expression. To make this connection between the two elements as close
as possible, the sentences to be given visual form should be taken from
the children themselves. These can be written on the board, or printed
in large type on Manila sheets (forming a chart),<a name="FNanchor_A_1"
id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
or in ordinary type on slips to be given to the children.</p>

<p>The possession by the class of the common subject-matter which the
stories supply, renders this plan feasible and always full of interest.
Knowledge of the content will reinforce the recognition of words and
sentences and thus make progress in acquiring a visual vocabulary
rapid and, in part, unconscious. Moreover, the anticipation of the
meaning of what is about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31"
id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> to be read will result in a natural
expression of it. If the child has even a provisional grasp of the
meaning of the whole sentence before attempting to read it, the
expression will largely take care of itself. Until the comprehension
of the meaning is instantaneous, there should always be a preliminary
study of the sentence to be read, so that the thought as a whole may at
least be foreshadowed in the mind of the child.</p>

<p>In this way there is a vital relation between reading as a formal
process and that which is read. This obviates the necessity of using
isolated and unfamiliar topics as well as those having no value in
themselves. From the first the reading matter should have value for
the child&mdash;be related to his stage of thought and to his dominant
interests.</p>

<h3>DRAWING, ETC.</h3>

<p>The stories are an excellent source from which to draw material
for expression in the various aesthetic exercises&mdash;drawing,
paper cutting, modeling clay, or dramatization. Whatever the form,
it should be the spontaneous portrayal of the child&#8217;s own
imagery. However crude the product may be, if it is a genuine attempt
at such expression, it has the essential element of an aesthetic
creation and should have our respect as such. With a very little
instruction in putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> on sky and ground, in representing
distance, progress will be rapid.</p>

<p>Drawing should be in a color medium, and be a daily exercise.
Paper-cutting is of absorbing interest to children and is a form of
school art that rapidly gives definiteness to the images of natural
objects. It brings out a high degree of manual dexterity and offers
almost as wide a scope for individual composition as drawing.</p>

<p>These exercises, not needing the teacher&#8217;s immediate
direction, can take the place of the many forms of meaningless
&#8220;busy work&#8221; that a misdirected ingenuity has devised for
the purpose of keeping children &#8220;still.&#8221;</p>

<h3>DRAMATIZATION.</h3>

<p>Another form to which the stories lend themselves readily is
dramatization. Children take intense delight in throwing striking
situations into dramatic form. This exercise also should be undirected.
If the story has not become crystallized into set phrases, this form of
reproduction becomes a genuine language exercise.</p>

<h3>CONSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p>In the foregoing we have examples of artistic creation. There
is a spontaneous impulse toward embodying in a suitable<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> form the
child&#8217;s own imagery. This activity goes on for its own sake; it
gives pleasure.</p>

<p>In construction proper, where direction is given and objects are
made from dictation to serve a useful purpose, we have activity passing
over into what is called work. This side should not be neglected.
Children are to live in a real world, where the purpose of activity is
not always in the activity itself but may lie in something external to
it. Things have to be made for certain definite purposes and because of
certain needs. These control the activity.</p>

<p>While it may be admitted that the stories do not form the ideal
connection for uniting such activity with the whole, yet, under present
conditions, they offer the only means practicable. Children will take a
deeper interest in making Red Riding Hood&#8217;s basket than in making
one that has not this ideal environment.</p>

<p>Attention is called to that excellent little manual,
&#8220;Construction Work,&#8221; by Worst, where measurements and
directions can be found for the construction of most of the familiar
articles of the household.</p>

<h3>THE MOTHER GOAT.</h3>

<p>Once there lived an old goat who had seven young ones. She loved
them as every mother loves her children. One day she wished to go into
the forest to get food for her children. So, calling them to her, she
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear children, I am going into the forest to get you
something to eat. Now be on your guard against the wolf; for, if he
comes here, he will eat you up. But you will know him by his rough
voice and his black feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little goats replied: &#8220;Dear mother, we will be very
careful and pay close attention to what you say. You need not be at all
anxious about us.&#8221; So the mother bleated a good-bye and ran off
quite contented.</p>

<p class="ph3">Model Treatment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE WOLF.</h3>

<p>Not long after the mother had gone the little goats heard a knock
at the door, and pretty soon a deep, rough voice said: &#8220;Open the
door, my dear children; it is your mother. She has brought each of you
something to eat.&#8221; But the little goats cried out: &#8220;You
are not our mother. You have a great, rough voice. You are the
wolf.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the wolf went to a shop near by where he bought some chalk. He
ate this and it made his voice soft and fine. Then he came back and
knocked again, and called out as softly as he could, &#8220;Open the
door, dear children; your mother has come from the forest and wants to
get in.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little goats were still afraid and said, &#8220;Put your
feet on the window-sill so that we can see them.&#8221; The wolf
did so and they at once cried out, &#8220;Oh! you are not our<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> mother.
You have black feet. You are the wicked wolf.&#8221; So the wolf turned
and went away.</p>

<p>2. Where does the wolf live? What kind of home has he? Is he a tame

<p class="roman2">III.</p>

<p class="ph3">Preparation.</p>

<p>The story now tells us how the wolf finally got into the house and
what he did there.</p>

<p>How do you think the wolf succeeded in deceiving the goats? How did
he change his voice? Do you wish to hear what the wolf next did?</p>

<p>What do you think he did? He made his voice soft and loving like
that of the mother goat. Do you think he could make his feet like hers?
How could he?</p>

<p>Let us hear what he did with his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39"
id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE WOLF IN THE HOUSE.</h3>

<p>The wolf did not know now what to do. Presently he thought, &#8220;I
will go to the baker.&#8221; So to the baker he went and said, &#8220;I
have hurt my feet; put some dough on them.&#8221; The baker felt sorry
for the wolf and put some dough on his feet.</p>

<p>Then the wolf ran to the miller and in a rough voice said,
&#8220;Strew some white flour on my feet.&#8221; The miller, thinking
the naughty wolf was going to deceive some one, did not want to do
it. But the wolf said, &#8220;If you do not do so at once, I will
eat you.&#8221; This made the miller afraid. So he powdered the
wolf&#8217;s feet with flour.</p>

<p>This done, the wolf went a third time to the door of the house and
said softly, &#8220;Open the door for me, dear children. It is your
mother. I have come back and brought each one of you something nice to
eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the little goats still remembered what their mother had said
and called out, &#8220;Show us your feet and we shall know whether you
are our mother or not.&#8221; The wolf put his feet in the window as
before. Now, when the little goats saw that the feet were white, they
thought that it was really their dear mother and opened the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40"
id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>But who should walk in but the wicked wolf! The little goats were
terribly frightened and each one ran to hide himself as best he could.
One ran under the table, the second hid in the bed, a third jumped into
the oven, a fourth slipped into the cupboard, a fifth hid in the back
kitchen among the pots and pans, a sixth hid under the wash-tub, and
the seventh hid in the clock case. But the wolf found them all and ate
them one after the other,&mdash;all but the youngest that hid in the
clock case. He did not find him.</p>

<p>Then he said to himself, &#8220;Well, well! I am tired. I must have
a nap.&#8221; And he went out into the green meadow and lay down to
sleep under a tree by a little brook.</p>

<p class="ph3">Model Treatment.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE MOTHER GOAT&#8217;S RETURN.</h3>

<p>Well, it was not long before the mother goat came back from the
forest with the food for her children. When she came near the house,
what a sight met her eyes! The door stood wide open. The table, the
chairs and the benches were overturned. The dishes were broken. The
quilts and pillows were on the floor. She was amazed. She looked
around, but not one little goat could she see. She sought for them,
but not one could she find. She called each by his name, but no one
answered.</p>

<p>Finally she heard a frightened little voice call out, &#8220;Dear
mother, here I am, hid in the clock case.&#8221; The mother goat<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> opened
the clock. There, sure enough, was the youngest little goat. As soon as
he could speak, he told his mother what had happened and how the wicked
wolf had swallowed the other little goats.</p>

<p>The mother goat was so grieved at first that she could not think
what to do. But presently she ran out, followed by her youngest child.
As they came to the meadow they saw the wolf lying under the tree fast
asleep. Then the mother thought, &#8220;Perhaps my children are still
alive.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sent the little goat to the house to fetch a pair of shears, a
needle, and some thread. She cut the wolf&#8217;s body open and one
of the little goats peeped out. As she cut farther, one after another
the six little goats jumped out. What joy there was! &#8220;Now,
children,&#8221; said the mother, &#8220;go fetch some stones.&#8221;
With these she filled up the wolf&#8217;s stomach. She then sewed up
his body.</p>

<p>By and by the wolf got upon his feet. He was thirsty and went down
to the brook to get a drink. As he put his head down to drink the heavy
stones in his stomach made him fall into the water and he was drowned.
When the little goats saw this they cried, &#8220;The wolf is dead! The
wolf is dead!&#8221; and danced for joy.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>AT HOME.</h3>

<p>There was once a very little girl who lived with her parents in a
pretty little cottage near a great forest. I do not know what her name
was. Her parents were kind and good and loved her dearly, for she was a
very sweet and loving child.</p>

<p>They lived together happily in their cheerful little home. Her
parents gave her food and clothing and at night she slept in a warm,
snug little bed very near them. These were happy times, indeed!</p>

<p>But all at once her dear father and mother took sick and died, and
she was left all alone with no one to care for her or give her food.
For a time she lived in the cottage; but at last there was nothing left
for her to eat but half a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>She was forsaken by all and wandered alone out into the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> fields
where the corn, the flowers and the potatoes grew. But she did not cry
nor get discouraged, for she thought that her Heavenly Father would

<h3>IN THE FIELDS.</h3>

<p>As she wandered there alone in the fields, she saw the stalks of
corn waving their tasseled heads. She thought they were nodding a good
morning to her. The flowers, too, seemed friendly.</p>

<p>As she went along she met an old man. His back was bowed with age
and his hair was white as snow. His clothes were torn and thin. In a
feeble voice he asked her to give him something to eat, as he was very
hungry.</p>

<p>The little girl was so sorry for him that she gave him the<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> half
loaf of bread which she carried in her pocket. &#8220;God bless you, my
child,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>She next met a little girl who was still poorer than she was, for
she had nothing on her head. Our little girl at once took off her own
hood and gave it to the poorer child.</p>

<p>To another child she gave her cloak. At last she met still another
child who was crying, and almost naked. To her she gave her dress.
As night was coming on she entered a great forest, where there were
many wild berries. She heard the birds singing and saw many friendly
animals, and here she passed the night.</p>

<p>She could see through the leaves far into the deep blue sky. The

her. And, as she watched them, all at once they left their places and
fell out of the sky right down to the earth.</p>

<p>She watched where they fell and, by the bright light of the moon,
she saw that they had become bright, hard, silver dollars. When she

<h3>AT HOME.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who lived with her
father and mother in a little house near the woods. This child had a
grandmother who lived by herself in a little house on the other side of
the woods. The grandmother loved the little granddaughter dearly and
was very kind to her.</p>

<p>One time she made the child a little cloak with a red hood. The
little girl looked very pretty in her cloak and hood; and when she
skipped along the street the neighbors would say. &#8220;Here comes our
little Red Riding Hood.&#8221;</p>

<p>One day Little Red Riding Hood&#8217;s mother called to her,
&#8220;Come, my child, put on your cloak and hood. I want you<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> to go
to see how dear grandmother is to-day. This is her birthday, and you
may take her a little present. See, in this basket I have put a loaf of
bread, a pat of fresh butter, and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, little daughter, listen to me. Do not leave the
path. If you meet any one, say &#8216;Good morning&#8217; politely, but
do not stop to talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little one said, &#8220;Yes, mother, I will mind all you
say.&#8221; She then took the basket, kissed her mother, and skipped
along the way to grandmother&#8217;s house.</p>

<h3>IN THE WOODS.</h3>

<p>As Red Riding Hood went along the path in the woods she met a big
gray wolf. He was a hungry wolf, and when he saw this rosy-cheeked
little girl he wanted to eat her. But he was afraid because there were
woodcutters at work near by.</p>

<p>He came close to Red Riding Hood and spoke to her. &#8220;Good
morning, little girl,&#8221; he said, &#8220;where are you going?<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>&#8221;
&#8220;Good morning, sir,&#8221; said Red Riding Hood; &#8220;I am
going to see my dear grandmother, who is sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you in the basket?&#8221; asked the wolf.
&#8220;Oh, I have a little present for my grandmother,&#8221; said
Red Riding Hood. &#8220;I am taking her a loaf of bread, a pat of
butter, and a bottle of wine. This is my dear grandmother&#8217;s
birthday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you pick a bunch of these lovely flowers for
your grandmother?&#8221; said the wolf. &#8220;Oh, I mustn&#8217;t
leave the path,&#8221; answered Red Riding Hood: &#8220;my mother
said so.&#8221; &#8220;She never meant that,&#8221; said the wolf.
&#8220;She would be pleased to have you take some of these beautiful
flowers to your poor sick grandmother. Where does your grandmother
live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandmother lives in the little house at the end of this
path,&#8221; said Red Riding Hood. &#8220;There are three tall trees
behind the house and nut bushes growing near.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, good-bye, little girl,&#8221; said the wolf; &#8220;be
sure you pick a large bunch of flowers for your grandmother.&#8221;
And off he strolled along the path towards the grandmother&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>When he got there he knocked at the door. The dear old grandmother
was lying down on the bed. She called out, &#8220;Who is there?&#8221;
&#8220;It is I, Red Riding Hood,&#8221; answered the wolf; &#8220;I
have brought you a birthday present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull the string and the latch will fly up,&#8221; said the
grandmother. The wolf pulled the string that hung on the outside<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> of the
door. Sure enough, the latch flew up and the door swung open.</p>

<p>Oh, how astonished the poor old grandmother was when the door opened
and in walked this big, hungry-looking wolf instead of her dear little
Red Riding Hood!</p>

<p>The wolf gave her no time to cry out. He sprang upon the bed and
swallowed the poor frightened grandmother before she had time to say a
word.</p>

<p>Then he dressed himself in her night-gown and cap and got into
bed.</p>

<h3>AT GRANDMOTHER&#8217;S HOUSE.</h3>

<p>By and by little Red Riding Hood came to her grandmother&#8217;s
house carrying her basket and the flowers she had gathered. She knocked
at the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52"
id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Who is there?&#8221; asked a voice. &#8220;It is little Red
Riding Hood, grandmother,&#8221; answered the child. &#8220;Pull the
string and the latch will fly up,&#8221; said the voice. Red Riding
Hood pulled the string. Up flew the latch, the door opened, and she
went in.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you a happy birthday, grandmother,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;See, I have brought you a little present and some pretty
flowers.&#8221; &#8220;Put them away,&#8221; said the voice from the
bed, &#8220;and come here; for I wish to talk to you.&#8221; Red Riding
Hood went over to the bed to talk to her grandmother.</p>

<p>Of course it was not her dear grandmother, but the wolf. But she did
not know that.</p>

<p>Red Riding Hood sat down on the bed. The room was so dark that she
could not see very well. But she wondered at the strange looking face
that looked at her from her grandmother&#8217;s nightcap.</p>

<p>&#8220;O grandmother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what big ears you
have.&#8221; &#8220;The better to hear you, my child.&#8221; &#8220;O
grandmother, what great eyes you have.&#8221; &#8220;The better to
see you, my child.&#8221; &#8220;O grandmother, what a big nose you
have.&#8221; &#8220;The better to smell you, my child.&#8221; &#8220;O
grandmother, what long teeth you have.&#8221; &#8220;The better to eat
you, my child,&#8221; cried the wolf; and he sprang up and was just
about to swallow poor little Red Riding Hood when the door burst open
and in came the woodcutters, who soon killed the wolf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53"

<p>Red Riding Hood told her mother all that had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was a naughty girl, dear mother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;to

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE LITTLE GIRL AND HER MOTHER.</h3>

<p>There was once a little girl who was very, very poor. When noon came
there was little dinner on the table for her, and at night the poor
child went hungry to bed.</p>

<p>In the morning, when she awoke, she was still hungry. She went to
the pantry, but there was nothing to eat in it. She went to the kitchen
and found nothing there but empty pots and pans.</p>

<p>Then the little girl went to her mother. &#8220;O mother,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;I am so hungry.&#8221; But the poor mother was sick in bed
and could not get anything for herself or for her child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55"
id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>When the mother was well she worked hard. She picked up wood in the
forest. She washed clothes and scrubbed floors. With the money she
earned she bought food for her little daughter and herself. But now the
mother was sick. She lay in bed all day, and both she and her daughter
were hungry.</p>

<p>Now, do you think the little girl fretted and cried? No, she did
not, because she knew that if she cried her sick mother would feel so
sorry and sad that she would be worse. This little girl was patient and
kind. She found at last one little piece of bread. She took it to her
mother and said, &#8220;Here, dear mother, is a piece of bread for you.
Eat it; it may make you stronger.&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE WONDERFUL POT.</h3>

<p>The little girl thought, &#8220;Is there not something I can do to
help my sick mother?&#8221; She did not sit down with her hands in her
lap and wait for something to eat to come to her. She said to herself,
&#8220;I must work. What can I do? I am too small to wash clothes. I am
too small to scrub floors. But I can go out into the woods. I will find
herbs there and berries. I can gather them and sell them. Then I will
buy bread, and we need not be hungry any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little girl went out into the woods. There she found ripe
berries. She began to pick them and put them into her little basket. An
old, old woman saw her. She stood and watched the child. She saw her
poor, thin little face, and that the child did not jump about and laugh
and sing as other children did when they came to the woods. She saw,
too, that this child did not eat even the smallest berry. As fast as
she picked them she dropped them into her small basket.</p>

<p>The old woman&#8217;s heart was full of pity for the poor little
child. She said, &#8220;My child, I will help you.&#8221; Then she
gave her a little earthen pot. It seemed a queer thing to give to this
child who had so many empty pots at home. But this was a wonderful pot.
The old woman told the child all about it. She said, &#8220;My child,
this little pot will cook very sweet and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> good rice porridge for you,
and you need not put anything into it at all. Just say, &#8220;Little
Pot, Cook!&#8221; and it will begin to cook the sweet rice porridge.
When you have enough say, &#8220;Little Pot, Stop!&#8221; and it will
stop.&#8221; The little girl thanked the kind old woman and ran home
with the wonderful pot.</p>

It is such a wonderful pot. All we need do is to say, &#8216;Little

enough, we must say, &#8216;Little Pot, Stop!&#8217; and it will stop
cooking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the little girl set the pot on the hearthstone. The mother
called out. &#8220;Little Pot. Cook!&#8221; Her voice was weak,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> but the
little pot heard and began to cook. Soon it was full up to the very
top with rice porridge. Then the mother called out, &#8220;Little Pot,
Stop!&#8221; and the wonderful little pot stopped.</p>

<p>Oh, how quickly the little girl ran to the cupboard! She brought out

<h3>THE FLOOD OF RICE.</h3>

<p>The mother was soon so well and strong that she could go to her
work again. Every day she and her daughter had rice porridge for
breakfast. When they had eaten their breakfast the mother always
put the pot away on a shelf and said, &#8220;Now, little daughter,
be a good girl. Take care of the house and do not touch the little
pot while I am gone. When I come home we shall have some more of the
porridge you like so much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59"
id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>And the little girl kissed her mother and promised to obey her. This
happened for many days. But one day the little girl said to herself,
&#8220;Dear me, I am very hungry. How good some of that rice porridge
would taste. I am sure I wouldn&#8217;t break the little pot. I would
be so very careful.&#8221;</p>

<p>She said this many times to herself. At last she stood upon a chair
and reached up to the high shelf where her mother had put the little
pot. She took it down and set it on the hearthstone. Then she said,
&#8220;Little Pot, Cook!&#8221; The little pot heard and began to cook.
The little girl got a plate and spoon and taking some rice sat down to
eat.</p>

<p>But she forgot all about speaking to the little pot and it went on
cooking. The child was so busy eating that she never noticed what was
happening. The wonderful pot was still cooking and the rice porridge
began running over. When the little girl saw it, she called out,
&#8220;Here, that is enough!&#8221; But the little pot did not stop and
the rice porridge poured out over the floor.</p>

<p>The little girl was frightened. She called out very loud,
&#8220;That is enough! Cook no more! Halt! Halt!&#8221; It was all of
no use. She had forgotten the right words to say and the little pot
kept on cooking. The rice porridge was still pouring out into the room.
Soon the chairs and the table were standing in it. The little girl was
more frightened than ever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60"
id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> She opened the door and ran out into the
yard and rice porridge came streaming out after her.</p>

<p>How the other children of the neighborhood laughed and shouted when
they saw the stream of rice porridge! They came running with spoons
in their hands and began to eat it. All the older people laughed and
wondered, too.</p>

<p>But soon the people became anxious. They said, &#8220;This rice
porridge will get into our houses and we shall all be drowned in
it.&#8221; So the people and their children ran into their houses and
shut all the doors and windows to keep out the rice porridge. The
streets were full of it. It rose up higher and higher. It covered up
the windows so that their houses were as dark as night.</p>

<h3>THE VALLEY FILLED UP.</h3>

<p>The little girl&#8217;s home was down in a valley. High up on
the mountain there stood a beautiful house. Rich persons<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> lived
there, and the little girl&#8217;s mother often went to work for them.
This very day, when the little girl had been so disobedient, her mother
was working in the house away up on the mountain.</p>

<p>When the little girl saw the rice porridge streaming out into the
streets and filling up the valley, she ran up the mountain&#8217;s side
as fast as she could to tell her mother all that had happened. As soon
as she saw her mother, she called out, &#8220;O mother, I took down the
little pot and told it to cook. When I wanted it to stop I forgot what
to say. It won&#8217;t stop cooking, and the whole valley is full of
rice porridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother called out softly &#8220;Little Pot, Stop!&#8221; and the
little pot heard her and stopped. But still the whole valley was full
of rice porridge. It covered the houses. It was up even to the church
steeple.</p>

<p>When the milkmen came in the morning they saw it. They called
out, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; The people shouted back, &#8220;It
is rice porridge. If you want to come to us, you must dig your way
through.&#8221; And it was so. Whoever wanted to go into that valley
had to dig his way through the sweet rice porridge that filled it.</p>

<p>For many days the people were busy eating rice porridge. As for the
little girl who had caused all this trouble, she felt very sorry and
ashamed, and I am sure was never disobedient again.</p>

<h3>THE LOST SPINDLE.</h3>

<p>There was once a widow who had two daughters. One was beautiful and
lazy, the other ugly and industrious. The mother, however, for some
reason showed more love for the beautiful one than she did for the ugly
one, who did all the work about the house.</p>

<p>Because her mother did not love her, she lived in the kitchen
and was very sad. The poor maid had to go out every day and sit by
the great road that ran near the house and<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> spin. Near the road was a
deep well. She liked best to sit near this because so many travelers
stopped there to draw the cool water from the deep well.</p>

<p>She spun so much yarn that her fingers became worn and thin, and
bled a great deal. One day it happened that her spindle slipped from
her fingers and fell into the well.</p>

<p>She was very much frightened and ran home, crying, to her mother,
and told her that she had lost her spindle in the well. The mother
scolded her and was so angry that at last she said, &#8220;Since you

<h3>THE MAID IN THE WELL.</h3>

<p>The maid went back to the road. She did not know how to get the
spindle out of the well. So she jumped down into the water to get it.
For a while she did not know anything, but presently she found herself
in a beautiful meadow where the sun was shining and many thousands of
flowers blooming all around her.</p>

<p>She got up and walked along till she came to a bake oven. The oven
was full of bread which cried out, &#8220;Draw me out or I shall burn.
I have baked long enough.&#8221; So she went up and took the bread
shovel that stood by the oven and drew out one loaf after another.</p>

<p>Then she walked on farther and came to an apple tree. The tree cried
out, &#8220;Shake me! Shake me! My apples are all ripe.&#8221; So she
shook the tree till the apples fell down like rain. When there were no
more left on the tree she gathered them into a heap and went on.</p>

<p>At last she came to a cottage out of which an old woman was peeping.
The old woman had such large teeth that the maid was frightened and
started to run away. But the old woman called her back, saying,
&#8220;Why are you afraid, my child? Stay with me. If you will put
things in order in my house, all will go well with you. Only you
must be careful and shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66"
id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> my bed well and make the feathers fly.
Then it will snow on the earth. I am old Mother Frost.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the old woman spoke kindly, the timid maid stayed and worked for
her. Everything was pleasant. Old Mother Frost was very kind and the
industrious maid was contented. She shook the bed well every day and
made the feathers fly downward as flakes of snow. She was very happy.
She had enough to eat and kind words from Mother Frost.</p>

<h3>THE RETURN HOME.</h3>

<p>The maiden stayed with Mother Frost a long time. But after a while
she became very sad. She did not know what the matter was. At last she
found that she was homesick; and, although she now fared a thousand
times better than when at home, she longed to go back.</p>

<p>So she said to Mother Frost, &#8220;I wish to go home to my mother
and sister.&#8221; Mother Frost replied, &#8220;It pleases me<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> that you
wish to go home; and since you have served me so faithfully, I will
myself take you home.&#8221; She thereupon took her by the hand and led
her to a great door. It flew open at their coming, and, as the maid
stood in the doorway, a shower of gold fell upon her. The gold remained
sticking in her hair, on her dress, and even in her shoes. &#8220;All
this gold is for you because you have been so faithful and industrious.
Here is your spindle also,&#8221; were the parting words of Mother
Frost.</p>

<p>When she stepped out the door closed behind her, and the maid
found herself near her mother&#8217;s house. As she came into the
yard the cock which was perched upon the hen-house cried out,
&#8220;Cock&mdash;a&mdash;doodle&mdash;do! Our golden maid comes home
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother and sister were surprised to see her, and because she had
so much gold they welcomed her very heartily.</p>

<h3>THE IDLE MAID.</h3>

<p>The good sister told all that had happened while she was away, and
when her mother heard how she came by all her gold she said to the lazy
sister, &#8220;You must try your luck, also.&#8221; So the mother had
her go and spin by the well. But the lazy girl soon became tired of
spinning and threw the spindle into the well. Then she jumped in after
it.</p>

<p>Like her sister, she came to the beautiful meadow and traveled
the same path. When she came to the bake oven, the bread called,
&#8220;Draw me out! Draw me out!&#8221; But the lazy maid said,
&#8220;I have no wish to make myself dirty with you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Soon she came to the apple tree. The tree cried out,
&#8220;Shake me! shake me! My apples are ripe.&#8221; But the maid
said, &#8220;I will not shake you. Your apples might fall on my
head.&#8221; She was not afraid of old Mother Frost, for she had
heard of her large teeth. She promised to serve her as her
sister had done.</p>

<p>The first day she worked hard because she thought of the
gold. The second day she began to grow careless. The third<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> day
she did not get up until noon. Mother Frost said, &#8220;I think
you are tired of working for me. You had better go home.&#8221; The
lazy maid was very glad; for she thought, &#8220;Now, I will get my
gold!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mother Frost led her also to the door; but, as she stood
within the doorway, instead of gold there was a shower of pitch.
&#8220;This is the reward for your service,&#8221; said Mother Frost,
and closed the door. As the lazy maid came home the cock cried,
&#8220;Cock&mdash;a&mdash;doodle&mdash;do! Our dirty maid comes home
again.&#8221; The pitch stuck to her as long as she lived.</p>

<h3>THE HOME.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, in a little house in the woods, there lived a poor
widow. The widow had a garden and in the garden were two beautiful rose
bushes. On one of these bushes there grew lovely red roses; on the
other the roses were as white as snow.</p>

<p>The widow had two daughters, who were both so sweet that she named
them after the roses. One of the daughters she called Snow-white and
the other Rose-red.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The children were both obedient and industrious, yet they were not
quite alike. Snow-white was quiet and gentle and fond of staying in the
house with her mother. Rose-red enjoyed running about the fields in
search of flowers and butterflies.</p>

<p>Snow-white and Rose-red helped their mother to keep the little house
clean and neat. They made the fire in the morning. They filled the
kettle with water from the spring and hung it over the fire. It was a
very bright little kettle, for it was made of copper and was polished
till it shone like gold.</p>

<p>After breakfast the sisters worked cheerfully together. Each one had
her share of the work. When that was done they learned their lessons
and did their sewing and knitting. In all this their mother was their
kind teacher and helper.</p>

<h3>HOW SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED PLAYED.</h3>

<p>Snow-white and Rose-red often played in the woods together. They
ran about and played hide and seek among the trees. They waded in the
little river. When they were tired of running about and sat down to
rest, they made wreaths of flowers or leaves which they wore upon their
heads.</p>

<p>Not one of the animals was afraid of them. The hares ate cabbage
leaves out of their hands. The deer ate grass by their side. The
squirrels knew the sisters well and came to eat the nuts they brought
for them. The birds, too, loved them and went on building their nests
or feeding their young ones. At the same time the birds sang their
sweetest songs for Rose-red and Snow-white.</p>

<h3>THE BEAR.</h3>

<p>It was a cold, stormy night in winter. Snow-white, Rose-red and
their mother sat by the fire.</p>

<p>The sisters were knitting while their mother read stories to them as
they worked. A pet lamb lay at their feet and a dove perched upon the
shelf above the fire-place.</p>

<p>Outside, the wind was howling and the snow fell fast. But it was
warm and bright in the snug little house.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a noise at the door. The mother stopped reading
and listened. She heard the noise again and said, &#8220;Some poor
traveler is lost in this fearful storm. Run, dear Snow-white, and let
him in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Snow-white jumped up and opened the door. In came, not a man, but a
big, shaggy bear.</p>

<p>Oh, how frightened the children were! They clung to their mother and
hid their faces in her dress. The lamb trembled and bleated. The dove
woke up in a fright and flew about the room.</p>

<p>Presently the bear said, &#8220;Do not be afraid. I will
not harm any of you.&#8221; The mother answered, &#8220;I am
sure you will not. Come, children, do not be afraid. This is a
kind, friendly bear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the mother told the bear to come close to the fire. When the
children saw him stretched out on the floor, like a great dog, they
lost their fear of him. Rose-red ran and fetched the broom to brush the
snow from his coat.</p>

<p>The poor bear was very cold; but he soon grew warm before the bright
fire. The children were not at all afraid of him now, but got upon his
back and rolled off on the floor. The bear enjoyed the fun as much as
they did. Only, when they pulled his rough coat too hard, he would say,
&#8220;Do not hurt your old friend, my dears.&#8221;</p>

<p>When bed time came the mother said, &#8220;I cannot think of turning
you out this stormy night. Stay here by the fire.&#8221; The bear
thanked her and stretched out on the warm hearthstone.</p>

<p>In the morning the children opened the door for him, and off he
trotted into the woods.</p>

<p>After that the bear came every evening. He lay down before the fire
and the children played with him until it was time to go to bed.</p>

<p>The winter passed by. The green grass was springing up in the
meadows, the tiny buds were breaking out into leaves and blossoms on
the trees.</p>

<p>One morning the bear said, &#8220;Children, I must say good-bye
to you. I am going away and you will not see me again until next
winter.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, where are you going, dear bear?<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8221;
said Snow-white. &#8220;I am going far away into the forest,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;There are many precious things buried in the ground.
In winter they are safe under the frozen earth. In the summer, when the
sun has made the ground soft, it will be easy for the wicked dwarfs who
live in the forest to dig down and take what I have buried. So I must
go to watch over my treasures.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children felt very sad as they said good-bye to their dear
playmate; but he promised to come back.</p>

<p>As he went out the latch of the door caught in his rough coat and
tore it. Snow-white thought that she saw something like gold glittering
under the shaggy hair; but she was not sure, for the bear trotted away
very quickly and soon disappeared among the trees.</p>

<h3>A DWARF IN TROUBLE.</h3>

<p>One day, not long after the bear had gone away, the mother sent
Snow-white and Rose-red into the woods to gather sticks. They saw a big
tree which the wind had blown down. As they drew near it they noticed
something jumping up and down on the fallen tree-trunk. At first they
could not tell what it was; but, when they went nearer, they saw it was
a little dwarf with a wrinkled face and a long, white beard.</p>

<p>The tree was split from top to bottom and the dwarf&#8217;s beard
was caught and held fast in the crack. He was jumping about at a great
rate, but he could not get free.</p>

<p>It was really a funny sight to see the dwarf hopping about, and
Snow-white and Rose-red could not keep from laughing. This made the
dwarf very angry. He cried out, &#8220;Why are you standing there
laughing instead of coming to help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The children, as you know, were kind-hearted; and when they saw how
the dwarf felt they pitied him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little man!&#8221; said Rose-red, &#8220;how did this
happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid thing,&#8221; said the dwarf, &#8220;what a silly
question. I was trying to split this tree that I might get wood for my
fire. I drove my wedge into the tree, but the wedge flew out. As<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> the
crack closed up again it caught my beard and holds it so tight I cannot
get it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children wished to help the poor dwarf. They went up to him
and tried to pull his beard out of the tree, but all their pulling
was of no use. &#8220;I will go home and get my mother,&#8221; said
Rose-red. &#8220;No, no,&#8221; shouted the dwarf, &#8220;do not bring
any more people here.&#8221; &#8220;I think I can help you,&#8221; said
Snow-white. She took a little pair of scissors out of her pocket and
cut the dwarf&#8217;s beard off close to the tree.</p>

<p>No sooner was he free than he caught up a bag full of gold which
was lying among the roots of the tree, swung it over his shoulder, and
walked away.</p>

<p>As he went he said something about stupid children who had cut
his beautiful white beard. And so, grumbling and without one word of
thanks, he was soon out of sight.</p>

<h3>THE DWARF FISHING.</h3>

<p>One pleasant summer day Snow-white and Rose-red went down to the
river. As they sat on the bank they saw something which they thought
was a big grasshopper jumping about. They went closer, to see what it
could be, and then they saw it was the dwarf.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; asked Rose-red; &#8220;are you
trying to jump into the water?&#8221; &#8220;Do you take me for a
fool?&#8221; cried the dwarf. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that this fish
is trying to drag me into the river?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sure enough, the children saw that the dwarf was in trouble again.
He was fishing, and the wind had blown his long beard about so that it
had become tangled in the fish line. A large fish was caught upon the
hook, and it was pulling as hard as it could to get away.</p>

<p>The dwarf held on by one hand to the rushes on the river bank, while
with the other hand he tried to untangle his beard from the line. But
the fish was stronger than the dwarf, and if the sisters had not held
on to him with all their might he would surely have been dragged into
the water and drowned.</p>

<p>They tried hard to free him, but could not. Snow-white had to take
out her little scissors again, and this time she had to cut off a long
piece of the dwarf&#8217;s beard. The dwarf was saved, but he was
in a great rage because his beard was cut.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span> He jumped about and scolded
the children until he was tired.</p>

<h3>THE DWARF AND AN EAGLE.</h3>

<p>One afternoon the mother sent Snow-white and Rose-red to town to buy
some things for her. They walked through the woods and finally came
to an open place. No trees grew here. It was covered with bushes, and
great rocks were lying about.</p>

<p>As the children walked along they saw an eagle flying in great
circles in the sky. At last he pounced down upon something. What it
was the sisters could not see, but they<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> heard loud cries for help.
Snow-white and Rose-red ran to the spot from which the cries came. And
then they saw the poor dwarf in great trouble.</p>

<p>The eagle had him in his strong claws and was carrying him away. The
children caught hold of the dwarf&#8217;s coat and held on with all
their might. The big bird beat them with his great wings. He pecked at
them with his strong bill, but they hung on to the dwarf&#8217;s coat.
At last the eagle let the dwarf go and flew away.</p>

<p>At first the dwarf could not speak, but stood trembling with fright.
When he was able to speak he said in a fretful voice, &#8220;What do
you mean by being so rough? See, you have torn my beautiful brown coat
nearly off my back!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he turned from them, picked up a bag, flung it over his

<h3>THE BEAR AGAIN.</h3>

<p>After Snow-white and Rose-red had seen the dwarf disappear behind
the rocks they went on to town. They got the things for which they were
sent and started back on their way home.</p>

<p>As they were walking along they saw the dwarf. He was sitting among
the rocks. He had emptied the bag of precious stones upon the ground
and was admiring them. How the stones sparkled and flashed in the
sunlight! Snow-white and Rose-red stopped to admire them, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you staring at?&#8221; cried the dwarf. &#8220;Go on
about your business.&#8221; He sprang to his feet as if to drive them
away, when all at once a terrible growl was heard and a big brown bear
rushed out of the bushes.</p>

<p>The dwarf tried to run away, but the bear stood right in his path.
Then the dwarf began to beg in a trembling voice, &#8220;O, dear Mr.
Bear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;spare my life. I am such a poor little
creature. I would not be a mouthful for you. See, here are two nice,
plump little girls. Eat them instead of me.&#8221; But the bear paid
no attention to him. Without a word he<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span> lifted up his fore paw and
with one blow laid the dwarf dead upon the ground.</p>

<p>Snow-white and Rose-red, in a great fright, were running away; but
the bear called to them, &#8220;Snow-white, Rose-red, do not be afraid;
it is I, your old friend and playmate.&#8221;</p>

<p>They knew his voice and stopped to wait for him. But imagine how
surprised they were when the shaggy bearskin fell to the ground and,
instead of a big bear, a handsome young man in splendid dress stood
before them!</p>

<p>&#8220;I am a king&#8217;s son,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and that
wicked dwarf changed me into a bear and robbed me of nearly all my
treasures. I have been obliged to wander about in the woods. At last he
is dead and I am free.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not many years afterwards Snow-white was married to the prince and
Rose-red to his brother.</p>

<p>The sisters took their dear mother to live with them in the
prince&#8217;s palace, and they all lived happily forever after.</p>

<p>The rose bushes were taken to the new home and planted in the
palace garden. There, year after year, they bore sweet red and white
roses&mdash;just as they had done in the little garden in the woods.</p>

<p>A talk about why they would go there and what they would find.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>ON THE MOUNTAIN.</h3>

<p>A cock once said to a hen, &#8220;It is now the time when the nuts
are ripe. Let us go to the nut mountain and eat all we can before the
squirrels carry them all away.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the hen;
&#8220;let us go and enjoy ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went to the mountain together and, as it was a bright, sunny
day, they stayed there until evening. Now, whether it was because
they had eaten too much, or whether they were too proud, I do not
know; but they did not want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84"
id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> go home on foot. The cock thereupon built
a small wagon out of the nut shells lying about.</p>

<p>When the wagon was ready, he seated himself in it and said to
the hen, &#8220;You be my horse and pull the wagon for me.&#8221;
&#8220;Indeed, I will not,&#8221; said the hen; &#8220;you be the horse
yourself. I will get upon the seat and be driver. I would rather walk
home than be your horse and pull the wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they were quarreling, a duck came out of the bushes. She was
very angry and said, &#8220;Who has given you permission to eat nuts on
my nut mountain? Wait a minute and it will cost you dearly.&#8221; Then
she rushed at the cock with outstretched neck to bite him. But the cock
flew at the duck and pecked her and struck her with his sharp spurs
till she was glad enough to stop fighting. The cock then harnessed the
duck to the wagon. He and the hen got in and away they went down the
mountain.</p>

<h3>THE TRAVELERS.</h3>

<p>The cock and the hen had not gone far when they heard a voice
calling to them to stop. The cock told the duck to stop, and found that
they had overtaken a pin and a needle traveling along the road. The
cock asked them what they wanted. The needle said, &#8220;It is now
getting dark and we fear that we shall lose our way. I have but one eye
and the pin has none at all. Please be so good as to let us ride with
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first the cock said, &#8220;No;&#8221; but the travelers begged
so hard that he at last consented. &#8220;You are so small,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;that you will take up no room. But you must be very
careful not to tread on the hen&#8217;s toes.&#8221;</p>

<p>They promised to be very careful and climbed into the wagon at once.
The cock told the duck to go on. &#8220;You<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> must be quick, Mrs.
Duck,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or we shall not get home to-night.&#8221;
So the duck waddled along as fast as she could. She could not go much
faster, for she was getting tired.</p>

<h3>AT THE INN.</h3>

<p>Late in the evening they came to an inn; and because the duck was
tired and the night dark, they drove up to the door.</p>

<p>The cock asked the innkeeper if they might stay over night. The
innkeeper did not like their looks and said at<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span> first, &#8220;No, I have
no room, and I think you have no money.&#8221; But the cock replied,
&#8220;You shall have the egg that the hen has laid and the one the
duck lays every day.&#8221; So the innkeeper consented. They all went
in, ate their supper, and lay down to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning, long before the other people at the hotel were
up, the cock and the hen took the egg, broke it, and ate it together.
The shell, however, they threw into the ashes in the fireplace. They
then waked up the needle and the pin. The needle they stuck into the
innkeeper&#8217;s chair and the pin into his towel. The duck, who slept
in the yard, heard them stirring around and flew to the brook and swam
away. The cock and the hen then hurried on to their home.</p>

<h3>THE INNKEEPER.</h3>

<p>In a couple of hours after the duck had taken to the water and the
cock and the hen had hurried away, the landlord awoke. He got up,
put on his clothes, washed himself, and reached for the towel. As
he wiped his face the pin made a deep red scratch across his cheek.
This made him angry. Then he went into the kitchen to light his pipe.
As he leaned over the fireplace to get a coal, the eggshell burst
and scattered the ashes into his face and eyes. This made him more
angry.</p>

<p>He went to his chair to sit down, but quickly jumped up again and
cried &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; Now he was very angry and said, &#8220;Those
ragamuffins that came here so late last night did this.&#8221; He went
to find them, but they could not be found. Then he said, &#8220;Never
again will I take such people into my house. They eat and drink and pay

<h3>DEATH OF THE COCK.</h3>

<p>Another time the cock and the hen went to the nut mountain. It was
a fine day and they were in the best of spirits. &#8220;Let us make a
promise,&#8221; said the cock, &#8220;that the first one that finds a
nut will share it with the other.&#8221; &#8220;I agree to that,&#8221;
said the hen.</p>

<p>The cock was the first to find a nut. It was a fine, large one.
He did not say anything about it, for he wanted it all himself. The
kernel, however, was so large that it stuck in<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> his throat. He tried every
way to get it out, but there it stuck. He at last cried to the hen,
&#8220;Dear hen, run quick and fetch me some water or I shall choke to
death.&#8221; The hen ran as fast as she could to the brook. But before
she could get back the cock had choked to death.</p>

<h3>THE FUNERAL.</h3>

<p>When the hen returned and found her mate dead, she was very sorry,
and she began to cry in a loud voice. While she was crying there came
six little mice, running up to see what was the matter. They felt sorry
for the poor hen and said, &#8220;Poor hen, we will help you.&#8221;
Then they made a little wagon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91"

was done, they harnessed themselves to the wagon. Then they said,
&#8220;We will draw the cock to his grave.&#8221; The hen walked
behind, weeping, and they all set out to bury the cock.</p>

<p>On the way they met a fox. The fox said, &#8220;What is the matter,
hen?&#8221; &#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the hen, &#8220;the cock is dead and
we are going to bury him.&#8221; &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; said the
fox. &#8220;May I go to the funeral?&#8221; As they went along they met

<h3>CROSSING THE RIVER.</h3>

<p>The six little mice went on with the wagon. The hen and her
friends walked behind. They passed through a forest and<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> across
a meadow, and finally came to a river. There was no bridge over this
river; but as the procession came to the river bank a straw, which
lay there, wanted to be helpful and said, &#8220;I will be your
bridge.&#8221; Then he laid himself across the water.</p>

<p>The little mice tried first to cross. They stepped upon the straw
bridge and snap! it broke. All the mice fell into the water and were
drowned. A coal then happened to come along. He said, &#8220;I am big
enough; I will lay myself over the water.&#8221; He had hardly touched
the water when he sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>The poor hen was very much frightened and did not know what to
do. Just then a long stone, that lay near and had seen all that had
happened, laid himself over the river. The hen took the wagon herself
and drew it over safe to the other side.</p>

<p>All the animals tried to go over, but there were so many of them
that the stone broke and they fell into the river and were drowned.
Then the hen was alone again. She dug a grave, laid the cock in it,
and made a little mound over it. When she had done this, the hen sat
upon the grave and grieved over the death of the cock till she, too,
died.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>HOW THE HUNTER FOUND BIRDIE.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a mother was walking through a woods
with a little child in her arms. She became very tired and sat
down under a tree to rest. She fell asleep as she sat there, and
the baby slept in her lap.</p>

<p>By and by an eagle that was flying far overhead saw the
child in the mother&#8217;s lap. He flew down, caught up the child
in his strong claws, and carried it away to his nest in a great
oak tree.</p>

<p>A hunter saw the eagle flying towards the oak tree. He
thought that he saw something strange in the eagle&#8217;s claws.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
He waited until the eagle had laid the child in his nest. Then
the hunter fired his gun. The noise frightened the eagle
away.</p>

<p>Climbing the tree, the hunter found the little baby lying in
the eagle&#8217;s nest. He took the little one in his strong arms
and carried it home with him. He had but one child&mdash;a little
daughter whose name was Lena.</p>

<p>When he brought the little one home he said, &#8220;Here is a
little sister for you, Lena. We will call her Birdie because I
found her in an eagle&#8217;s nest.&#8221; Lena was glad to see the baby
girl, and kissed her. The two children played and ate and
slept together. They grew to love each other so much that, if
they were parted for even a little while, they felt lonely and
sad.</p>

<h3>THE COOK.</h3>

<p>An old woman lived in the hunter&#8217;s home. She was the cook. She
was busy all day long doing the work and taking care of the children,
for Lena&#8217;s mother was dead.</p>

<p>The hunter went out early in the morning. At night he came home,
bringing what he had shot in the woods. Then he played with the
children or told them wonderful stories.</p>

<p>Lena and her father both loved Birdie dearly and were always kind to
her. But the old cook did not love her at all. She was angry when the
hunter brought the little child home. She had more work to do caring
for two children than for one; and the children were often noisy in
their play. All this made the old cook dislike Birdie. So she made up
her mind to get rid of her.</p>

<p>A great iron pot stood in the kitchen. One day Lena saw the old cook
carrying pails of water from the spring near the house. She poured
the water into the big pot and went for more. This she did again and
again.</p>

<p>Lena wondered why she was doing this. She asked, &#8220;Why are you
carrying in so much water?&#8221; The cook looked around to see if
anyone else were near. Then she whispered to Lena, &#8220;I will tell
you, Lena, if you promise never, never to<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> tell anyone.&#8221; Lena
promised. Then the old woman said, &#8220;I do not like Birdie. I am
filling this big pot with water and to-morrow, when your father is
gone, I will drown her in it.&#8221;</p>

<h3>HOW BIRDIE WAS SAVED.</h3>

<p>Lena felt very sad indeed when the old cook said, &#8220;I am going
to drown Birdie.&#8221; Oh, how sorry she was that she had made such a
promise! All day long she thought about it and grew sadder and sadder.
Birdie would ask, &#8220;What is the matter, dear Lena?&#8221; But Lena
would say, &#8220;I cannot tell you, Birdie.&#8221;</p>

<p>Night came and the children went to bed; but Lena could not sleep.
At last she said to herself, &#8220;That was not a good promise. I will
not keep it.&#8221; So she woke Birdie and told her all about what the
old cook had said and done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97"
id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she said, &#8220;But I can save you, Birdie, if you will trust
me and do just as I say.&#8221; &#8220;O, Lena,&#8221; said Birdie,
&#8220;I do trust you. I know you love me and I will do just as you
say.&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; said Lena, &#8220;let us get up and
dress ourselves. We will slip quietly out of the house and hide in
the forest before the old cook is up.&#8221; So the children dressed
themselves. They went softly out of the house and ran far away into the
forest.</p>

<p>When the hunter had eaten his breakfast and left the house,
the old cook went to the children&#8217;s room to get Birdie. How
astonished she was to find the bed empty and both the children gone.
How frightened she felt when she thought of the hunter&#8217;s anger
when he should come home. &#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what
shall I say when the hunter comes home and finds that the children are
gone?&#8221;</p>

<h3>THE SEARCH.</h3>

<p>The cook sent the servants to look for Birdie and Lena. They went
into the woods looking everywhere, behind trees and among the bushes.
Lena saw them coming towards the place where she and Birdie were
hiding. &#8220;Birdie,&#8221; she said, &#8220;will you do just as I
say?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, Lena,&#8221; said Birdie, &#8220;I will.&#8221;
&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Lena, &#8220;we must change quickly so that
the servants will not find us. You must be a rosebush, Birdie, and
I will be a red rose growing upon it.&#8221; As she spoke they were
changed. Birdie became a rosebush and Lena a sweet red rose growing
upon it.</p>

<p>The servants came and looked all around for the children; but, as
they could not find them anywhere, they went back to the house. The old
cook was at the window watching anxiously for them. &#8220;Where are
the children?&#8221; she cried. &#8220;We could not find them,&#8221;
answered the servants. &#8220;We thought once that we saw them, but
when we reached the place they were nowhere to be seen. There was
nothing there but a rosebush with a rose upon it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O you stupid things,&#8221; cried the cook; &#8220;why did
you not bring me the rose? Go back and get it.<span class="pagenum"><a

where they had seen the rosebush and rose, Lena saw them coming.
&#8220;We must change again, dear Birdie,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You
must be a church and I will be the steeple.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the servants came to the place the rosebush and the rose
were gone. And there stood a tiny church with a tall steeple! The
servants were astonished. They said to one another, &#8220;I did
not see that church here before. Did you? Well, we can not find the
rosebush and rose, so we may as well go back. My! but won&#8217;t

<h3>THE COOK PUNISHED.</h3>

<p>So the cook set out to look for the children herself and the
servants went with her. By and by they came near the place where
Birdie and Lena were. Lena saw them coming because she was the
steeple and could see far around her. &#8220;O Birdie,&#8221; she
cried, &#8220;here comes the old cook. We must change again. You
must be a pond, dear Birdie, and I will be a duck swimming upon the
pond.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was no sooner said than done; and when the old woman and the
servants came, the church and the steeple had disappeared. And there,
among the trees, they saw a little pond with a snow-white duck
swimming upon it. &#8220;There they are,&#8221; cried the wicked old
woman; &#8220;I am going to drink all that<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> water up.&#8221; And so
saying she stooped down to drink up all the water; but she lost her
balance and, falling head-first into the pond, was drowned.</p>

<p>Birdie and Lena took back their own shapes again. You may be sure
the servants were astonished when they heard the whole story. As for
the old cook, they said, &#8220;She was a wicked woman; she is well
punished.&#8221;</p>

<p>The children went back to the house and, when the hunter came home,
told him all about the old woman&#8217;s wicked plan and how Birdie
was saved. He, too, said, &#8220;She was a wicked woman. She is well
punished.&#8221; And now that the old cook was gone, Birdie and her
kind friends lived happily together all the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>A wolf made a fox get his food for him. He made him take food from
farmers&#8217; yards and houses.</p>

<p>What kind of food would a wolf find in a farmer&#8217;s yard?</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>AT THE FARMYARD.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a wolf caught a fox and kept him as a servant.
Whatever the wolf said, the fox must do. One day they were going
through a forest and the wolf said to the fox, &#8220;Get me some
food or I will eat you.&#8221; The fox said, &#8220;I know a farmyard
where there are two young lambs which, if you wish, I will fetch for
you?&#8221; This pleased the wolf very much. They went to the farmyard
and the fox, slipping slyly into the yard, stole a fine young lamb and
brought it to the wolf.</p>

<p>When he had done this he ran away, leaving the wolf alone to
enjoy his dinner. The wolf quickly devoured the lamb, but<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> did
not feel satisfied. He wanted more, and went to get the other lamb from
the yard. But he was so clumsy and made so much noise that the mother
sheep heard him. She cried out, &#8220;Baa! baa!&#8221; This wakened
the farmers and they came running to help her. They found the wolf and,
before the thief could get over the fence, they beat him severely. He
ran limping to the fox and said, &#8220;You have led me into a fine
place! When I went to get the other lamb the farmers came out and beat
me terribly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because you are such a glutton,&#8221; said the fox.
&#8220;You always want too much.&#8221;</p>

<h3>AT THE FARM HOUSE.</h3>

<p>The next day the wolf and the fox again went into the forest
and the greedy wolf said to the fox. &#8220;Get me something<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> to
eat right quick or I will eat you!&#8221; The fox said he knew of a
farm house near by where the cook was going to make some pancakes that
very day. So they turned and went there.</p>

<p>When they got there the sly fox crept up very quietly and entered
the house. He sneaked around till he found where the dish was that held
the pancakes. He then slyly drew out six of the cakes and took them to
the wolf, saying, &#8220;Here is something for you to eat,&#8221; and
ran away as before.</p>

<p>The wolf ate them and, in a minute or two, wishing to have more, he
went into the house and tried to get some out of the dish. But he was
so clumsy that he knocked the dish down. It fell with a loud crash and
was broken in pieces. The noise alarmed the cook who came running out.
When she saw the wolf she called the family. The farmer came and beat
him with such good will that he ran home to the fox howling, and with
two lame legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a fine place you have drawn me into now!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;The farmers have caught me again and dressed my skin
till my bones cracked.&#8221; &#8220;Why, then, are you such a
glutton?&#8221; asked the fox.</p>

<p class="roman2">III.</p>

<p>On the third day they visited a farmer&#8217;s cellar.</p>

<h3>IN THE CELLAR.</h3>

<p>They went out again the third day, the wolf limping along very
painfully. When they were some distance from home the wolf said to the
fox, &#8220;Get me something to eat quick, or I will eat you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The fox said he knew a man who had just killed a pig and salted it
down in a cask in his cellar. The wolf replied, &#8220;I will go with
you if you promise to help me if we get into trouble.&#8221; &#8220;Of
course I will help you,&#8221; said the fox, and showed him how to get
into the cellar.</p>

<p>Once in, there was plenty of meat. The wolf was delighted at the
sight and set to work at once. The fox, too, liked meat; but he kept
looking around while eating and running now and then to the hole
through which they came, to see if his body would still slip through
easily. Presently the wolf asked, &#8220;Why are you running about
so?&#8221; &#8220;I want to see if any one is coming,&#8221; replied
the cunning fox. &#8220;Mind you don&#8217;t eat too much!&#8221;</p>

<p>The wolf said he would not leave till all the meat was eaten.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the farmer, who had heard the noise made by the pair in
the cellar, walked in. The fox, as soon as he saw him, made a spring
and was out through the hole in a jiffy.</p>

<p>The wolf tried to follow, but he had eaten so much that his<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> body
was too big for the hole and he stuck fast. Then came the farmer with a
stout cudgel and beat him to death.</p>

<p>The fox ran away into the forest, very glad to be rid of his greedy
master.</p>

<h2>THE STREET MUSICIANS.</h2>

<p class="roman">I.</p>

<p class="ph3">Preparation.</p>

<p>Our story to-day tells of four animals that formed a plan to go to a
city called Bremen and become street musicians. But darkness overtook
them on the way and they had to spend the night in a forest. What
animals might become musicians? What music can each one make? Tell
about street musicians you have seen. What kind of instruments did they
play on?</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>HOW THE MUSICIANS CAME TOGETHER.</h3>

<p>A man once had a donkey that, for many years, had carried heavy
sacks of grain to the mill for him. At last the donkey grew old. He
became weak and could no longer carry heavy loads.</p>

<p>One day, as he was eating hay in his stall, he heard his master say,
&#8220;That old donkey is good for nothing. I am not going to feed him
any longer. When he dies I will have his tough old hide for a cover to
my wagon.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the poor donkey felt very sad. He said to himself:<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
&#8220;I have worked hard for my master all these years and now the
hard-hearted man cares nothing for me and is going to turn me out and
let me die of starvation. But he is mistaken about that. I will not
stay here to die. I will help myself. I have always had a beautiful,
strong voice. It is fine and good yet. I will go to the great city,
Bremen, and be a street musician. The people will gladly pay to hear
such fine music as I can make; and with the money I can buy food for
myself in my old age.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the old donkey set out on the road to Bremen. As he walked along
he saw a dog lying by the roadside. The dog was panting and seemed
very tired. The donkey stopped and looked at him. &#8220;What is the
matter with you?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You look as if you are in
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I am in trouble,&#8221; said the dog. &#8220;I am
too old and weak to go hunting with my master and I heard him say
this morning that he intends to kill me. No wonder I am sad.&#8221;
The donkey replied: &#8220;I have just left my master because he was
going to turn me out to starve, and I am going to Bremen to be a street
musician and earn my living. You may go, too. So come along; we will go
together.&#8221; &#8220;That I will,&#8221; said the dog. So the two
went on side by side toward the city.</p>

<p>By and by they came to a cat sitting on a fence by the roadside.
She looked as though she had not a friend in all the wide world.
The two friends stopped to speak to her.<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> &#8220;What is the
matter with you, old whiskers?&#8221; said the donkey. &#8220;You look
as dismal as three days of rainy weather.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No wonder,&#8221; answered the cat. &#8220;I am now too
old to catch mice; my teeth are gone and my claws are dull; and my
heartless master says he is going to drown me in the pond.&#8221;
&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; said the donkey. &#8220;We two are going to
be musicians. You can sing tenor to our bass. You are just the one we
want. Come with us to Bremen.&#8221; The cat thanked the donkey for the
kind invitation and said she was delighted with the plan and would go
gladly. So the three went on towards Bremen.</p>

<p>As they were passing by a farm they saw a cock perched upon a barn
door. He was crowing as loud as he could. The donkey called out,
&#8220;What ails you, old red comb? You are crowing as if you meant
to split your throat.&#8221; &#8220;I am crowing while I can,&#8221;
said the cock; &#8220;to-morrow the cook is going to put me into the
soup pot.&#8221; And he went on crowing louder than ever. &#8220;I can
tell you something better than that,&#8221; said the donkey. &#8220;We
are all going to be musicians. You have a fine voice, so come with
us.&#8221; &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said the cock. &#8220;I will gladly
go. I have no taste for soup.&#8221; He flew down, and the four friends
went on merrily together.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Tell what the donkey had done all his life. Why did his master want
to get rid of him? Give the conversation between the donkey and the
dog, the donkey and each of the other animals.</p>

<p>To what city were the animals going? Bremen is a large city in
Germany, across the ocean. Do you know any one that has come from
Germany? Do you live in a city? In what large city have you been? Which
is the more useful, the donkey or the dog? Tell what each does for us.

<p class="roman2">II.</p>

<p class="ph3">Preparation.</p>

<p>I will now tell you how the four musicians passed the night in a
forest on the way to Bremen, and what happened to them there. Do you
remember any one in the stories we have heard that passed the night
in a forest? Tell how it happened? Why does one not like to stay in a
forest all night? What dangers are there in a forest?</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>IN THE FOREST.</h3>

<p>The four companions could not reach Bremen in one day, so must
pass the night on the road. Night came on them as they were passing
through a deep forest. They could no longer see the way, and so
they stopped. The donkey leaned up against a great tree. The dog
lay on the ground beneath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111"
id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> the cat curled herself up on a branch,
and the cock flew up to the very top.</p>

<p>After a time the cock said, &#8220;I see a light. It seems to
come from the window of a house.&#8221; &#8220;Oh,&#8221; said the
donkey, &#8220;let us go to it; perhaps some kind people live in the
house. They may give us something to eat. I am hungry. I would like a
mouthful of hay.&#8221; &#8220;I would be thankful for even a couple of
bones,&#8221; said the dog. The cat and the cock, too, were hungry. So
the four animals went on toward the light.</p>

<p>As they came nearer the light grew larger and clearer. Finally they
came to a house, the home of a band of robbers. The donkey, being
the largest, went to the window and looked in. &#8220;What do you
see?&#8221; said the cock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I see a table with all kinds of good things to eat on it.
Around it there seems to be a band of robbers, eating and drinking and
having a merry time,&#8221; said the donkey.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be something there for us,&#8221; said the cock.
&#8220;Yes, indeed!&#8221; said the donkey. &#8220;Some of that food
must be for us.&#8221; The four animals then agreed upon a plan to
frighten the robbers away from the house so that they might go in and
eat. The donkey put his fore feet on the window sill. The dog jumped up
on the donkey&#8217;s back. The cat sprang up on the dog&#8217;s back,
and the cock flew up on top of the cat.</p>

<p>When they were all ready, each one made his music as loud<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> as
he could. The donkey brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the
cock crowed. The noise they made was so loud and strong that the window
rattled and the whole house shook. The robbers heard the noise outside
but could not tell what it was. They were all terribly frightened.
One thought it was the police. Another cried, &#8220;It is the
soldiers!&#8221;</p>

<p>And so hallowing, one this, the other that, they ran pell mell out
of the house and hid in the woods. Then the four friends went in and
sat at the robbers&#8217; table and ate and drank until they were
satisfied. Then they put out the light and each one found a comfortable
place in which to sleep. The donkey stretched himself out on some straw
in the yard. The dog lay behind the door. The cat lay down by the
hearth, and the cock flew up on the rafter. They were so tired after
their long journey that they were soon fast asleep, and so all was
quiet in the little house in the woods.</p>

<p class="ph3">Model Treatment.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Where did the animals plan to spend the night? Tell how each one

away.</p>

<p>In what stories have you heard of a cock? Tell how the cat differs
from the dog. Of what use are cats? How do they catch mice? Did you
ever see a cat sharpen her claws? What animals are like cats?</p>

<p>Why did the robbers live in the forest?</p>

<p>Why were they so easily frightened?</p>

<p>Why did they think of police and soldiers?</p></div>

<p class="ph3">Preparation.</p>

<p>We shall now learn that the robbers came back while the
four musicians were asleep in the house, and what happened.
Tell where each animal went to sleep. What do you think
they did when the robbers came back? Let us see.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE ROBBERS RETURN.</h3>

<p>The robbers did not go very far away. They hid in the woods and
watched to see what went on in the house. Along about midnight one of
the robbers said: &#8220;See, the light is out. Perhaps the police have
gone away.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said all the other robbers, as
they looked, &#8220;the light is out.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain of the robbers then sent one of the band to see if all
was safe. He stole softly through the woods and crept into the house.
When once in he saw something shining in the fireplace. It was the
cat&#8217;s eyes, but he thought it was two coals of fire. So he took
the candle from the table and stooped to light it at the coals. The
cat at once sprang at him and scratched his face with her claws. The
robber, badly scared, ran out of the house. As he ran, the dog awoke
and bit him in the leg. The donkey kicked him, and the cock<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> cried
out, &#8220;Cock&mdash;a&mdash;doodle&mdash;do.&#8221; Still worse
frightened, he ran back to where the others were hiding.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t go back there for
the world! There was a terrible old woman sitting by the fireplace.
She scratched me with her long finger nails. A man lay behind the
door: he cut me in the leg with his long knife. A giant, who was lying
in the yard, struck me with his great club. Then some one cried out,
&#8216;Bring a rope and hang the thief.&#8217; So I ran back as fast as
I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the other robbers heard this they all said, &#8220;No, it is
not safe to go back there;&#8221; and they went away to another part
of the country. The four musicians liked the little house in the woods
so much that they remained there all the rest of their days in joy and
comfort.</p>

<p class="ph3">Model Treatment.</p>

<h2>THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN.</h2>

<p>The story of a straw, a coal, and a bean. How they met, how they
started on a journey, and what happened to them.</p>

<p>Children imagine how they could meet.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE MEETING.</h3>

<p>In a little house in a village there once lived an old woman. One
day this old woman went to her garden and picked some beans for her
dinner. She had a fire on the hearth, but to make it burn brighter she
threw on a handful of straw.</p>

<p>One of the straws slipped out of her fingers and lay on the floor.
As she threw the beans into the pot to boil, a bean fell on the floor
and lay quite near the straw. Suddenly a red-hot coal bounced out of
the fire and fell close to the straw and the bean.</p>

<p>They both started away, calling out, &#8220;Friend, do not come
near us until you are cooler. What brings you out here?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh!&#8221; said the coal, &#8220;the heat made me so strong that
I was able to bounce from the fire. And a lucky thing it was for<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> me,
too, for if I had stayed there I would surely have been burned to
ashes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the bean said, &#8220;I also had a narrow escape. If the old
woman had put me into the pot with the others, I would certainly have
been boiled to death.&#8221; &#8220;It was a good thing for me,&#8221;
said the straw, &#8220;that I slipped through the old woman&#8217;s
fingers, or I would have been burned with the others.&#8221; And so the
three talked as they lay on the hearthstone together.</p>

may be.</p>

<p>Explain <i>tailor</i>.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE JOURNEY.</h3>

<p>After the straw, the coal and the bean had talked together
awhile, the coal said, &#8220;Well, what shall we do now?&#8221;
&#8220;I think,&#8221; said the bean, &#8220;that we had better
leave this place as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> quickly as possible. If the old woman
sees us she will put me into the pot.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said
the straw, &#8220;that is a good idea. Let us go quickly and travel to
some more friendly country.&#8221; So the three set off together.</p>

<p>By and by they came to a little stream over which there was no
bridge. They were puzzled to know how to get across. Finally the straw
said, &#8220;I will place myself across the stream and you can walk
over me as if I were a bridge.&#8221; So the straw laid himself from
one bank to the other and the coal started to trip gaily across. But
when he reached the middle he heard the waters rushing under him. He
became frightened and stood still. It was a great pity that he did
this, for, as he was quite hot, the straw became scorched. It broke in
two, fell into the water, and floated away. The coal fell in also and,
with a hiss, sank to the bottom of the stream.</p>

<p>The bean, who had remained upon the bank, saw all that had happened
to her two friends. It seemed so funny to her that she laughed and
laughed until she burst her skin. She was now as badly off as the

<h3>HOW CINDERELLA GOT HER NAME.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there was a girl whose father and mother were rich.
They lived in a beautiful house and had everything that they could
want. They loved each other very much and lived happily together.</p>

<p>But one day the mother became very sick and, as she grew worse and
worse, she knew that she was going to die. She called her daughter
to her and said: &#8220;My child, I am going to leave you. When I am
gone, remember that I have tried to teach you to be good and kind and
loving.&#8221;</p>

<p>The daughter promised that she would never forget what her dear
mother had taught her. They kissed each other lovingly, and not long
after the mother died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121"
id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>After a while the father brought a new wife home. He thought that
this lady would be a kind mother to his daughter.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. The new wife was not at all kind. She was proud
and bad-tempered. And she had two young lady daughters who were even
worse than their mother.</p>

<p>One day, not long after the new mother and sisters had come to
the little girl&#8217;s home, they were all sitting together in the
parlor.</p>

<p>One of the sisters said: &#8220;Mother, must we have her sitting
with us all the time? We don&#8217;t want her here. Send her into the
kitchen and let her do the work.&#8221; And the mother said to the
little girl, &#8220;Yes, go into the kitchen and work. We do not want
you here. Go quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the daughter of the house went into the kitchen and began to
work. The sisters came out after a while and looked at her as she
worked. One of them said, &#8220;That dress is altogether too pretty
for you; give it to me.&#8221; The other sister said, &#8220;Take off
those pretty shoes and give them to me.&#8221; She gave her pretty
shoes and dress to her sisters, who threw a ragged old dress and wooden
shoes to her saying, &#8220;Here, take these; they are good enough for
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they said to her, &#8220;Your bedroom is too nice for a girl
who works in the kitchen. We want that room for ourselves; you may
sleep here.&#8221; As she had nowhere else to sleep, the poor girl
slept in the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122"
id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>It was often cold there at night after the fire had gone out. So she
would creep into the great fireplace and curl herself up into the warm
ashes and sleep.</p>

<p>Her sisters found this out. But, instead of being sorry for her,
they laughed at her and called her Cinderella, the ash-girl.</p>

<p>Cinderella&#8217;s father goes to a fair and promises to bring each
one a present. What will each ask for?</p>

<p>Explain <i>fair</i>. <i>Pearl necklace.</i></p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE FAIR.</h3>

<p>There was a large town near Cinderella&#8217;s home. Every year
there was a fair in this town. The people who had things to sell
brought them to the fair.</p>

<p>If you were to walk through the streets of this town you would
see booths gaily trimmed with flags and flowers and the branches of
trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123"
id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>There were many pretty things for sale in these booths. There were
silks and satins. There were rings and bracelets and necklaces; and
there were toys for boys and girls.</p>

<p>People walked about looking at the beautiful things in the booths.
There was music and dancing, and everybody was gay and happy.</p>

<p>One morning Cinderella&#8217;s father said, &#8220;I am going to
the fair. I will buy each of you girls a present, so tell me what you
want.&#8221; The oldest one said, &#8220;O papa, bring me a pretty
silk dress. I need a new party dress.&#8221; &#8220;Oh!&#8221; cried
the second sister, &#8220;I must have a pearl necklace. Do bring me
a beautiful pearl necklace.&#8221; &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the
father, &#8220;you shall have what you want.&#8221; Then he turned
to Cinderella and asked, &#8220;And what shall I bring you, my
daughter?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I do not want anything from the
fair, father. But please bring me the first branch that touches your
hat as you ride home through the forest.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two sisters laughed and said: &#8220;What a goose you are,
Cinderella. Why don&#8217;t you ask for something nice?&#8221; Her
father said, &#8220;Yes, daughter, I will bring you anything you
wish from the fair.&#8221; But Cinderella said, &#8220;I do not want
anything, father, but the first branch that touches your hat as you
ride home through the forest.&#8221; So the father mounted his horse
and rode off to the fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124"
id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>By and by he came back; and sure enough he brought the silk dress
and the pearl necklace to the sisters, and to Cinderella he gave the
branch she had asked for.</p>

<p>She took the branch and planted it on her mother&#8217;s grave.
Every day she watered it and at last the branch grew to be a fine
tree. Its roots reached down into the ground. Its branches spread out
on every side. The birds came and built their nests in it. How glad
Cinderella was to see her tree growing so big and strong! When she felt
sad and lonely, she went out to her dear tree and it comforted her.
The birds, too, were her friends. She talked to them, and brought them
crumbs to eat, and they sang their sweetest songs for her.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE BALL.</h3>

<p>The king of the country in which Cinderella lived had a son.
When this son was twenty-one years old the king said<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> to
the queen, &#8220;Let us give a grand ball for our son. We will invite
all the beautiful young ladies of the land so that our son can choose a
wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The king and queen sent out invitations to the ball and
Cinderella&#8217;s father and mother were invited to come and bring
their daughters. The ball was to last three nights, and everyone
expected to have a very fine time, indeed.</p>

<p>How glad Cinderella&#8217;s sisters were when the invitations came.
They said, &#8220;We must get out our most beautiful dresses and our
loveliest ornaments; and you, Cinderella, must help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so poor little Cinderella had to run to and fro helping her
proud sisters to get ready for the ball.</p>

<p>At last the day of the ball came. Oh, how busy Cinderella was! She
had to brush and comb her sisters&#8217; hair. She had to sew bows on
their slippers. She had to help them dress.</p>

<p>&#8220;O sisters,&#8221; she said at last, &#8220;I wish I could
go to the ball, too. I would like to see the king and queen, and the
handsome young prince.&#8221; But her sisters said, &#8220;Nonsense!
Your dress is too ragged and your shoes are too clumsy. You cannot
go.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Cinderella went to the mother and asked her if she might go to
the ball. The mother took a peck of seeds and flung them out into
the backyard where they fell among the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> ashes. &#8220;Now,
Cinderella,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you pick up all of those seeds
in an hour, you may go to the ball.&#8221; Cinderella stood in the
yard and began to call, in her soft, sweet voice: &#8220;Come, little
pigeons and turtle doves. If you don&#8217;t help me, what shall I
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>Down flew the pigeons and the turtle doves and all the birds who
knew and loved Cinderella. Down they came and set to work to help her.
Pick! pick! pick! with their sharp little bills, and soon all the seeds
were out of the ashes and back in the peck measure again.</p>

<p>Then Cinderella ran to her mother. &#8220;See, mother,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;here are the seeds. Now may I go to the ball?&#8221; But
the mother said, &#8220;No, you cannot go;&#8221; and turning her back
on the poor girl she and her daughters went to the ball.</p>

<h3>HOW CINDERELLA WENT TO THE BALL.</h3>

<p>After her mother and sisters had gone to the ball, Cinderella felt
very lonely and sad. She sat in the kitchen for a while. Then she said
to herself, &#8220;I will go out to my dear tree; perhaps it will help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>How pretty and strong the tree looked in the moonlight. Cinderella
thought, &#8220;Surely, my dear tree will help me.&#8221; Then she
said aloud, &#8220;Rustle and shake yourself, dear tree. Throw gold
and silver down on me.&#8221; And what do you think happened? Why, the
tree shook its branches and down dropped such lovely things,&mdash;a
beautiful, snow-white dress, all trimmed with gold and silver; and the
prettiest little slippers in the world.</p>

<p>Oh, how glad Cinderella was! You may be sure she dressed herself
quickly and went to the ball. And when she got there she was the
prettiest and sweetest looking girl in all that great company. The
prince danced with her. The king and queen spoke kindly to her. They
also said to one another, &#8220;She is a lovely maiden, so sweet and
gentle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her mother and sisters did not know her at all. They never thought
that the happy looking girl in the beautiful ball dress was their
Cinderella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128"
id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>When it grew late, Cinderella stole quietly out of the ball-room
and ran home. She took off her pretty things and took them back to
the tree. Then she lay down in her bed in the ashes and was soon fast
asleep.</p>

<p>When her sisters and their mother came home they woke her. &#8220;O
Cinderella!&#8221; they said, &#8220;we had a delightful time. And
there was the most beautiful girl there! She wore a dress all trimmed
with gold and silver. And the prince danced with her. We wondered who
she could be.&#8221; Cinderella laughed softly to herself, but she said
never a word.</p>

<p>The second night of the ball came. Cinderella&#8217;s sisters had
kept her running back and forth waiting upon them; but at last they
were dressed.</p>

<p>As soon as they and their mother had gone, Cinderella ran out to her
kind friend, the tree. Again she called out, &#8220;Rustle and shake
yourself, dear tree. Throw gold and silver down on me.&#8221; And down
fell a lovely ball dress, prettier even than the one she wore the night
before. When Cinderella reached the ball-room, the prince was waiting
for her. The king and queen welcomed her; and everyone seemed glad to
see this sweet-faced, happy maiden.</p>

<p>How happy Cinderella was! She forgot all about her ragged dress, her
clumsy wooden shoes, and her bed in the ashes. She was the happiest of
all in that great ball-room.</p>

<p>When it grew late, she again stole quietly away and ran<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> home.
She took off her pretty things and laid them down under the tree, and
they were quickly gone. She was asleep when the sisters came home; but
they woke her to help them undress and to listen to all their talk
about the ball.</p>

<p>The last night of the ball came. How anxious the sisters were to
look as fine as possible! How hard they made Cinderella work getting
them ready! How cross they were because their dresses were not handsome
enough, and how gentle and kind dear Cinderella was to them!</p>

<p>At last they were gone, and Cinderella hurried out to her tree.
Again she called out in her sweet voice, &#8220;Rustle and shake
yourself, dear tree. Throw gold and silver down on me.&#8221; I wish
you could have seen the lovely things that the tree threw down. Such a
beautiful dress! Such dear little slippers! And I wish you could have
seen Cinderella when she was dressed in all those pretty things.</p>

<p>The prince was waiting for her. He took her by the hand and lead her
to his father and mother. &#8220;See, dear father and mother,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;this is the sweetest maiden in all the world. This is the
one I choose to be my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Cinderella and the prince were married. Cinderella lived in
the palace the rest of her life, and never, never again slept in the
ashes.</p>

night overtook him on a journey and how he was refused a place to sleep

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE TRAVELER.</h3>

<p>A long time ago there was a wonderful traveler passing
through a country. He was tired, footsore, and hungry. It<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
happened that night overtook him when he was a long way from an inn. He
did not know what he should do.</p>

<p>Finally, as he trudged along, he came to two houses standing
opposite each other. One was large and beautiful, the other was small
and ugly. The large house belonged to a proud, selfish man; the other
to a modest, generous man.</p>

<p>The traveler thought, &#8220;Now, I would not be a burden to the
man who lives in the large house because he has so much room. I will
knock at his door.&#8221; As he knocked the owner raised a window,
looked out, and asked of the stranger what he wanted. The poor traveler
answered, &#8220;I ask only a place to sleep over night.&#8221; The
proud man looked the stranger over from head to foot. And because his
clothes were poor and soiled with dust, and because he did not look
like one who had money to pay for his lodging, the owner shook his
head and said, &#8220;I cannot take you in, for my house is full.
If I received into my house everyone that came along, I should soon
have to go begging myself. Seek elsewhere for your night&#8217;s
lodging.&#8221; At that he closed the window with a bang, and left the
poor traveler standing without in the darkness.</p>

<p>The weary traveler then went to the cottage and knocked gently
at the door. Scarcely had he knocked when the generous man unlocked
his door and cheerfully called out, &#8220;Come in, stranger, and
pass the night with me. It is now quite dark. You can go on your
journey in the morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132"
id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>This welcome pleased the traveler and he went in. The good
man&#8217;s wife took him by the hand. &#8220;We have not much,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;but what we have you are welcome to.&#8221; She then
put some potatoes on the fire to bake. While they were cooking she
milked the goats so that there might be a little milk for the evening
meal.</p>

<p class="ph3">Suggestions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Tell of the two houses that the wonderful traveler came to on
his journey. To whom did the houses belong? Why did the traveler knock

did the proud man refuse the traveler a night&#8217;s lodging? Tell the
words he used. Where, then, did the traveler turn? How was he received
at the cottage? Tell what was said. What did the wife say and do?</p>

<p>Reproduction.</p>

<p>2. What animal furnishes us milk?</p>

<p>Where are cows kept? Who brings us milk?</p>

<p>3. Do you like it that the traveler was refused a night&#8217;s lodging at
the mansion? What should the owner have said to him? Was the proud
man kind? Was he friendly? Do we always welcome strangers? Would
we take strangers into our homes?</p>

<p>4. What can you say of the poor man and his wife? What shall
we say of them? Were they generous, kind, hospitable? (They gave the
stranger welcome and the best they had.)</p>

<p>5. Why did the proud man look at the traveler&#8217;s clothes?
Who else refused to keep lodgers over night because he thought at
first they could not pay? (Landlord in &#8220;The Cock and The

of three wishes he granted to the good old man and his wife. What do
you suppose the good people asked for?</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE KIND MAN GRANTS WISHES.</h3>

<p>When the table was spread, they all sat down and ate. The plain food
tasted good to them because they were all happy. After they had eaten,
and bedtime had come, the good woman said to her husband, &#8220;Let us
make for ourselves a bed of straw on the floor and give our bed to the
traveler so that he may rest well. He has been traveling the whole day
and must be very weary.&#8221; &#8220;With all my heart,&#8221; said
her husband; &#8220;I will offer our bed to him.&#8221; Then he went to
the stranger and said to him, &#8220;We want you to sleep in our bed
to-night. You are tired and you can rest better there.&#8221;</p>

<p>At first the stranger would not take the bed from the old people.
But they would not take no for an answer, so finally he consented and
lay down for the night in the comfortable bed. The two old people made
a bed of straw on the floor. Early the next morning they were up. They
cooked their guest a breakfast of the best they had.</p>

<p>As the sun shone through the window the traveler arose, ate his
simple meal with the good man and his wife, and was about to depart.
As he stood in the door, ready to go, he turned to them and said.
&#8220;Because you are so good and hospitable,<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> you may make three
wishes and I will fulfill them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old people were surprised and at first did not know what to
say. Then they wished as the first wish that they might always be
contented. For the second, that they might always have health and their
daily bread. For their third wish they did not know what to wish. But
the wonderful traveler looked at their poor little house and said,
&#8220;Would you not like to have a new house as your last wish?&#8221;
&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; they cried. &#8220;A new house would please us
best of anything.&#8221; The wonderful traveler then gave them their
wish and changed their old house into a new, large and beautiful one.
When he had done this, he bade them good-bye and departed.</p>

<p class="ph3">Suggestions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Why did the food taste good? What offer did the good man and
wife make the traveler? Where did they sleep? What did the wonderful
traveler offer to the good people? What was their first wish? Their
second? Their third? Reproduction.</p>

<p>2. Tell in what ways the good man and wife were kind, generous, and
hospitable. What pleases you in the treatment of the traveler? Do you
like the three wishes? What might they have wished for? What is it to
be contented? Do you know any who are never contented? Who was not
contented in &#8220;Mother Frost&#8221;? In &#8220;The Wolf and the

and how he found out about the three wishes. Also how he overtook

himself.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE PROUD MAN OVERTAKES THE TRAVELER.</h3>

<p>When the proud man arose and looked out of his window, imagine his
surprise to see a beautiful new house, with red-tiled roof and bright
windows, where the ugly little hut had stood the night before. He
called his wife and said, &#8220;Just see there! How could it have
happened? Yesterday evening the ugly little hut stood there. Now there
is a beautiful new house. Run over there quickly and learn how it
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wife ran over to the new house and inquired of the good people
how it came there. The generous man told her of the wonderful traveler
who had sought a night&#8217;s lodging and who, at his departure the
next morning, had granted them three wishes&mdash;contentedness, health
and daily bread, and a fine new, red-tiled house.</p>

<p>When the proud man&#8217;s wife heard this, she hastened back and
told her husband all that had happened. The man said. &#8220;What
a fool I am! Had I only known! That man knocked at our door last
night, but I sent him away.&#8221; &#8220;Then,&#8221; said his wife,
&#8220;hurry, get on your horse! You can overtake him and maybe he
will grant you three wishes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136"
id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>So the proud man jumped on his horse and rode after the traveler.
He soon overtook him and said, &#8220;I hope you will forgive me for
not letting you in last night. I went to find the door key and when I
returned with it you had gone. When you come this way again, you must
stop with me.&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the traveler, &#8220;when
I come this way again I will stop at your house.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the proud man asked, &#8220;May I not also have three wishes
fulfilled like my neighbor?&#8221; &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the
traveler, &#8220;you may; but it would be better for you not to wish
for anything.&#8221; The proud man replied, &#8220;I would certainly
seek out something that would make me happy if I only knew that it
would be given me.&#8221; &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said the traveler,
&#8220;go home and your three wishes shall be fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<p>We will next learn how the proud man had his wishes
granted. What do you suppose he will wish for? Let us see.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE PROUD MAN&#8217;S WISHES.</h3>

<p>Now that the proud man had obtained what he wanted, he started home
very happy and began to think what he would wish for. As he rode along
he let the bridle reins hang loose on the horse&#8217;s neck. All at
once his horse began to jump and rear upon his hind feet. His master
patted him on the neck and said, &#8220;Be still, there.&#8221; But
the horse jumped and reared all the more. At last the master became
very angry and said, &#8220;I wish you would break your neck.&#8221; No
sooner had he spoken the words than his horse fell backward, broke his
neck, and died. Thus was the first wish of the proud man fulfilled.</p>

<p>But the proud man was very careful not to lose anything,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> so he
took the saddle from the dead horse, threw it on his back, and started
home on foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;I have two wishes left.&#8221;
In this way he comforted himself. His road lay through deep sand. It
was noon. The sun shone hot and the saddle made his back sore. This
made him sigh. He was so warm and uncomfortable. He had not yet made up
his mind what to wish. He turned many things over in his mind. &#8220;I
will manage it,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;so that there will be nothing
more in all the world to wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many times he thought, &#8220;Now I have found it.&#8221; But
presently it would seem that his wish was too small. Then he began to
think of his wife sitting at home in the cool house enjoying herself.
This made him out of humor and, without thinking, he said, &#8220;I
wish that she sat there at home on my saddle, and could not get free
from it, instead of its being here on my back!&#8221; No sooner said
than he felt the saddle disappear and knew that his second wish had
been granted.</p>

<p>Then he began to be afraid and he ran toward home as fast as he
could. He wanted to get home and sit down in a quiet room and think
what he would ask for in his third wish. He wanted to wish something as
large as he could. But, as he came to his house and opened the door,
there sat his wife on the saddle. She was very red in the face, and
very angry, and she shrieked at the top of her voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Be contented,&#8221; said her husband. &#8220;I am going to
wish you all the riches in the world. Just be quiet.&#8221; But she
answered, &#8220;What good would all the riches in the world do me if
I have to sit on this saddle always? You have wished me on it and now
you must wish me off.&#8221; The proud man must now, whether willing
or not, use his third wish to get his wife free from the saddle. So he
said, &#8220;I wish you may get off the saddle.&#8221;</p>

<p>When his wife stood again upon her feet she began to scold her
foolish husband. &#8220;You are very silly and stupid,&#8221; she
exclaimed; &#8220;I could have managed it much better.&#8221; Thus the
proud man had nothing for his pains but anger, scolding, and a dead
horse. His neighbors, however, lived contented and quiet, but happy,
till the end of their days.</p>

<p class="ph3">Suggestions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Tell how the proud man started home. What did the horse do? Tell
about the man&#8217;s first wish. Tell about the saddle. What put him
out of humor? How did he think he would manage his remaining wishes?
Tell about his second wish. Why did he hasten home? What did he find
there? Tell about his third wish. What did his wife say to him when she
regained her liberty? What had he for his pains? How did his neighbors
live?</p>

<p>Reproduction.</p>

<p>2. Where have you seen a horse with saddle and bridle on? What is
the saddle used for? The reins? How is the saddle fastened on? Do you
know the names of some parts of the horse&#8217;s harness? I will tell
you some. Here is a picture of a horse with harness on. [Show picture.]
Tell how horses are used. Which is more useful, a horse or a donkey? In
what story did we learn of a donkey? Which do we like better? Do men
ride donkeys, too? Tell how we should care for our horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140"

<p>3. Was the traveler right when he told the proud man it would be
better if he did not wish at all? Why did he fare so badly in his
wishes? Why didn&#8217;t he wish better things?</p>

<p>Was he as wise as his neighbor?</p>

<p>Was he as happy?</p>

<h2>HANS AND THE FOUR BIG GIANTS.</h2>

<p>The story of a boy who lived in the country. The story tells of his
home life, how he went away to work in a great city, how he wished to
serve a lovely princess, and how four great giants helped him. First,
we shall hear of his home in the country. Talk of country sights and
sounds. Children give their experiences.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE HOME IN THE COUNTRY.</h3>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a little boy whose name was Hans. His
home was in a village where the tall trees shaded the green grass that
grew around the houses. Hans loved his home very much. He loved to hear
the birds sing and to watch them fly high in the air, and he often
threw crumbs upon the ground for them to eat.</p>

<p>He loved the bright red and blue and yellow flowers which grew in
the garden behind the house. He delighted in sweet odors which came
all unseen from their very hearts. So he<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> gladly watered them when
they looked thirsty. His mother soon taught him how to place strong,
straight sticks beside the weak vines so that they, too, could climb up
and get the sunlight.</p>

<p>Hans loved the dear old hens and their downy chickens that were
not afraid to peck the grain out of his hand. In fact, Hans loved
everything and everybody about him, from the small naked worms which
crawled about among the clods of earth, up to the strange and beautiful
stars which shone so high above his head. He was a very happy little
fellow, always busy, always finding something to do for somebody.</p>

<h3>LEAVING HOME.</h3>

<p>By and by, when Hans grew to be a tall, strong lad, he used to go
with his father to the forest to chop wood and thus help earn money
which went to buy food and clothes for his mother and his three younger
brothers. For Hans&#8217; father was poor, and money was scarce in his
family.</p>

<p>After a time, when Hans had grown so tall that you and I would call
him a young man, his father said to him, &#8220;Hans, my boy, it is
time now that you started out to hunt some work for yourself. Your next
younger brother can help me with the wood-chopping and the smaller ones
can help the mother in the work about the house. You must go out into
the world and learn how to take care of yourself; and perhaps, some
day, you may have to take care of your mother and me, when we grow too
old to work.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Hans&#8217; mother packed his clothes in a little bundle; and, as
she kissed him good-bye, she said, &#8220;Hans, my precious son, always
be brave and true, and the good God will take care of you.&#8221; Hans
then bade farewell to his father and his younger brothers and started
on his journey.</p>

<h3>HANS IN THE CITY.</h3>

<p>Hans walked a long way until, by and by, he came to a great city,
where the houses looked dingy with smoke and the rattle of the carts
and wagons made a roaring noise.</p>

<p>After a time he found some work in the shop of a blacksmith and,
although the work was grimy and rather hard to do, Hans used to like to
see the sparks fly from the red-hot iron every time he struck a blow
with his heavy hammer.</p>

<p>He was very proud when, at last, he could shape the iron into a fine
horse-shoe almost as well as the smith himself. Hans did not know it,
but this very work was making his arms grow big and strong, and his
chest broad and full.</p>

<h3>THE KING&#8217;S PALACE.</h3>

<p>Every day Hans used to see a beautiful princess drive past the
blacksmith&#8217;s shop. She was the most beautiful princess in the
world; and, although her blue eyes and golden hair were admired by
everyone, she was chiefly beloved because of her sweet smile.</p>

<p>Hans used often to say to himself, &#8220;How I wish I could serve
this lovely princess.&#8221; At last one day he went to the palace
gate and asked the gate-keeper if there was not some work in the
palace which he could do. &#8220;What can you do?&#8221; asked the
gate-keeper. &#8220;I am willing to do any kind of work which the king
may need to have done,&#8221; answered Hans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146"
id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the gate-keeper passed him on to the keeper of the king&#8217;s
palace. &#8220;What can you do?&#8221; asked the keeper of the
king&#8217;s palace, also. &#8220;I am willing to do any kind of work
which the king may need to have done,&#8221; replied Hans. So the
keeper of the palace told the king that there was a strong, tall young
man without who wanted to serve him.</p>

<p>When Hans came into the presence of the mighty king, the monarch
looked at him very hard for a few moments and then said, &#8220;What
can you do, young man?&#8221; And again Hans replied, &#8220;I am
willing to do anything that you need to have done. I would like to
serve the lovely princess.&#8221; &#8220;You would, would you?&#8221;
cried the king. &#8220;Now, I will test you. In the bottom of the North
Sea there lies a string of enchanted pearls. If you will get those
pearls and bring them to me, you shall serve my daughter, the princess,
and in time I may make you governor over one of my provinces,&mdash;who
knows?&#8221; And the king laughed to himself. Hans was wild with
delight and, turning, hastened out of the palace.</p>

<h3>HANS STARTS ON HIS JOURNEY.</h3>

<p>The very next day Hans started on his journey to the North Sea. He
walked a long ways, and until he was very tired. At length, just ahead
of him he saw a big giant rushing along in a very strange fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221; said Hans, as he caught up with
the giant. &#8220;What a very large giant you are!&#8221;
&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the giant, looking down at Hans, &#8220;I
have need to be both large and strong. Where are you going, young
man?&#8221; &#8220;I am going,&#8221; answered Hans, &#8220;to the
North Sea, to get a string of enchanted pearls which lies at the bottom
of the sea.&#8221; &#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the tall giant, &#8220;it
will take a long time to get there. Now, if you could walk as fast as I
can, it would be an easy matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How fast can you walk?&#8221; asked Hans. &#8220;I can
walk faster than a greyhound can run,&#8221; said the giant,
&#8220;and when I run swiftly, a river cannot keep pace with
me.&#8221; &#8220;Can you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148"
id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> indeed?&#8221; exclaimed Hans;
&#8220;what a fine fellow you are! I wish you would come along
with me. After I find the string of pearls I want to get back to
the king&#8217;s palace as soon as possible, for I am to serve the
beautiful princess.&#8221; &#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said
the giant, &#8220;I think I will go along with you.&#8221; And the two
went along together.</p>

<h3>HANS MEETS A SECOND GIANT.</h3>

<p>Hans and the first giant went along together until they saw what
Hans thought must be a huge, round stone lying in the road. When,
however, they came up to it, he saw that it was another big giant
lying asleep by the roadside. The hot<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> sun was pouring down
upon his face. &#8220;Stay here,&#8221; said Hans, &#8220;until I can
cut a branch from some tree to shade that poor fellow&#8217;s face. The
sun is so hot it will soon blister him.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words, the first giant laughed aloud. &#8220;Ho, ho!&#8221;
he cried, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know who that is? He is a neighbor of
mine. He has such strong eyes that he can see a fly on a leaf of a tree
a mile away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The loud laugh of the first giant awoke the sleeping giant, and he
opened his great eyes and stared at Hans. &#8220;What are you doing,
young man?&#8221; growled he. &#8220;Oh, nothing,&#8221; said Hans;
&#8220;I was merely sticking these branches into the ground so that
they might keep the sun out of your face.&#8221; &#8220;Bah!&#8221;
cried the great giant, sitting up. &#8220;Did you not know that my
eyes are so strong that I could look the noonday sun straight in the
face?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed! Indeed!&#8221; said Hans; &#8220;what a wonderful
giant you must be! I wish you would come with me. I may need
your strong eyes, for I am on my way to the North Sea to search
for an enchanted necklace of pearls which lies at the bottom of
the sea.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, ho!&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;if
that&#8217;s the case, I think I will go with you.&#8221; So Hans and
the two big giants walked on together.</p>

than three or four miles when Hans spied another great giant sitting
under a tall tree.</p>

<p>As they came up to him the wind blew his hat off his head. &#8220;I
will fetch it for you,&#8221; cried Hans, as he ran forward after the
hat. But, before he could get to the spot where the hat lay, the big
giant reached out his long arm and himself picked up his hat and put it
again on his head.</p>

<p>At this all three of the huge giants laughed. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t
you know that he is the giant who can reach five hundred
yards?&#8221; asked the long-legged giant. &#8220;No,&#8221;
exclaimed Hans, clapping his hands with delight. &#8220;You are just
the giant I need. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151"
id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> I get to the North Sea you can reach
down to the bottom of it and pick up the enchanted necklace of pearls.
Will you not come and help me?&#8221; The new giant thought for a
minute or two, and then said, &#8220;Oh, yes, I will go along if I can
be of any use to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hans and the three big giants had not gone far before Hans saw in
the distance another giant quietly leaning up against a very large
rock. He seemed so deep in thought that he did not see Hans and his
fellow travelers until they came near to where he stood.</p>

<p>Hans noticed that both of this giant&#8217;s ears were stopped<span

<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; said the giant, &#8220;I merely stuffed cotton
into my ears to shut off some of the sounds about me. I can hear so
well that I can tell what men are saying a hundred miles away from
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a valuable giant you must be!&#8221; exclaimed Hans.
&#8220;Will you not come with us? When I get the enchanted necklace of
pearls, you can tell me whether it will be safe to take it back to the
king&#8217;s palace.&#8221;</p>

<p>The giant, being very good-natured, said, &#8220;You think you will
need me, do you? Well, I&#8217;ll go along.&#8221; So Hans and the four
big giants walked on.</p>

<h3>HOW HANS GOT THE NECKLACE.</h3>

<p>Hans and the four giants went on until they came to the North Sea.
Then they got a boat and rowed out to the deep water. The giant who
could see so far soon found the place where the necklace lay on the
sand at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Then the giant whose arms were long reached down and picked up the
necklace and laid it in the boat.</p>

<p>Hans and the giants now rowed back to the shore. As soon as they
had landed, the giant who could hear so well took the cotton out of
his right ear and listened to what was being said at the king&#8217;s
palace. He heard the people in the palace talking of a grand festival
which was to take place the next night in honor of the birthday of the
beautiful princess.</p>

<p>He told Hans what he had heard, and the giant who could run so
fast stooped down and let Hans climb up and seat himself on his great
shoulders. Away the two sped, faster than a bird could fly. They
reached the palace in time for Hans to give the enchanted necklace of
pearls to the king, just as he was about to seat his beautiful daughter
on a throne beside his own.</p>

<p>The king was so pleased to get the necklace that he at once gave
Hans the office of serving the beautiful princess. Hans served her so
faithfully that she learned to love him dearly, and in time they were
married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154"
id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>When the old king died, Hans was made king and the beautiful
princess was queen.</p>

<p>Hans, you may be sure, took good care of his old father and mother,
and both he and his queen did everything they could to make all the
people in their kingdom industrious and happy.</p>

<p>Hans persuaded his four friends, the giants, to come and live in
his kingdom and through them it became the richest and most prosperous
country on the face of the earth, so that travelers came from all over
the world to visit it.</p>

tells about the pleasant home this little tree had, and yet that it was
discontented.</p>

<p>The children imagine why the tree was discontented.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>IN THE FOREST.</h3>

<p>Far away in the forest grew a pretty little fir tree. The sun shone
on this little tree. The birds sang to it. The wind kissed it. Other
trees grew around it. The forest was a very pleasant place, and yet the
fir tree was unhappy.</p>

<p>It wanted to be tall and old like the big pines and firs which grew
around it. Sometimes little children came with baskets of berries. They
would sit upon the ground near the fir tree; and as they ate berries,
they chatted merrily. &#8220;Is this not a pretty little tree?&#8221;
they would say. And the fir tree felt more unhappy than ever because
the children called it little.</p>

<p>Yet all the while it was growing taller and stronger. Still, as it
grew, it would sigh and say, &#8220;Oh, how I wish I were as<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> tall
as the other trees! I would spread out my branches on every side. My
top would overlook the wide world. The birds would build their nests
in my branches, and when the wind blew I would gracefully bow my
head.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tree was so discontented that it took no pleasure in the warm
sunshine, the merry birds, or the rosy clouds that floated over it
morning and evening.</p>

<p>When winter came the snow lay white and glistening upon the ground.
Then a frisky hare came springing along. Right over the little fir
tree it jumped, and oh, how vexed the little fir tree was! Two winters
passed by. When the third winter came the tree was so tall that the
hare had to run around it. But still the foolish tree was discontented
and said, &#8220;Oh, if I could only be taller and older! There is
nothing else I wish for in all the world.&#8221;</p>

the tallest fir trees.</p>

<p>Recall mention of wood-cutters and their work. The children imagine

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE WOOD-CUTTERS.</h3>

<p>In the autumn wood-cutters came to the forest with their shining
axes. They set to work to cut down some of the fir tree&#8217;s tall
neighbors. Chop, chop, chop, how their axes flew! And crash! the great
trees fell upon the ground. The wood-cutters chopped off all the
branches. How bare and straight the trees looked!</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what will happen next,&#8221; thought the fir tree.
It soon found out, for all these bare trunks were piled upon wagons
which were drawn out of the forest by horses. &#8220;Where can they be
going?&#8221; thought the fir tree. &#8220;How I wish I knew! How I
wish I were going, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>In the spring, when the swallows and the storks came back, the
fir tree told them about the wood-cutters&#8217; visit. &#8220;Tell
me,&#8221; it said, &#8220;do you know where those trees were
taken?&#8221; The swallows said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221;
But a wise old stork<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158"
id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> nodded his head and said, &#8220;Yes, I
think I know. I met some new ships as I flew over the sea. These ships
had tall masts that smelt like fir. I think they were the trees you
spoke of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the sea? What does it look like?&#8221; asked the fir
tree. &#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said the stork, &#8220;I cannot stop here
to tell you. I must go on to my home.&#8221; And away he flew.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up,&#8221; said the happy sunbeams to the fir tree. The
gentle south wind kissed it. The dew watered it. But still the fir tree
was unhappy.</p>

<h3>OTHER TREES GO FROM THE FOREST.</h3>

<p>Christmas time drew near and men came to the forest again. This
time many young trees were cut down. These<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> trees, which were very
pretty, kept their branches. They were laid in wagons and drawn by
horses out of the forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are they going?&#8221; asked the fir tree. &#8220;They
are not taller than I am. Indeed, one is not so tall. And their
branches are not cut off. Where can they be going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We know, we know,&#8221; chirped the sparrows. &#8220;We
have looked in at the windows of the houses in town, and we know what
is done with those pretty young trees. They are dressed up in the most
splendid manner. We have seen them standing up in the middle of a warm
room. They had many beautiful things hanging upon them, and hundreds of
gay-colored candles were fastened to the branches.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what happened then?&#8221; asked the fir tree. &#8220;We
did not see any more,&#8221; said the sparrows. &#8220;I wonder if
anything so fine will ever happen to me?&#8221; thought the fir tree.
&#8220;Oh, how happy I should be! I wish I were on the wagon, or
standing in the warm room with all the brightness around me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be glad with us,&#8221; said the sunbeams. &#8220;Be
glad,&#8221; said the sweet, fresh air. But still the fir tree was
discontented and longed to leave its home in the forest.</p>

<p>The story tells how the fir tree at last got what it had wished for
so long. The children recall the fir tree&#8217;s wish to be tall and
old, and to leave the forest.</p>

<p class="ph3">Narration.</p>

<h3>THE FIR TREE HAS ITS WISH.</h3>

<p>One year, just before Christmas, the wood-cutters came again to the
forest. They set to work and cut down the discontented fir tree first
of all. It was laid on the wagon with other trees and drawn out of the
forest.</p>

<p>The fir tree had its wish. It was leaving its home in the
forest. But now that the time had come, its heart was sad. It knew
that it would never again see the other trees, nor the little
bushes, nor the many bright-eyed flowers that had grown around it.
&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said the tree, &#8220;I may never again see my
friends, the merry birds.&#8221; And it felt very sad, indeed.</p>

<p>On it was carried until, at last, it stopped before a large house in
the great city. The fir tree heard a man say, &#8220;We want only one
and this is the prettiest.&#8221; Then two servants came and carried
the tree into a large and very beautiful room. A handsome carpet
was on the floor. Pictures hung upon the<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> walls. Near the great
stove stood huge china vases with lions on their lids. There were
rocking chairs, and sofas covered with silks. There were many tables
loaded with picture-books and playthings. The fir tree was set up in a
tub full of sand, but a green cloth was hung all around the tub so that
no one could see it.</p>

<p>Soon some young ladies came in and began to trim the tree. How
busily they worked! How pretty they made the tree look! On it they
hung little bags made of colored paper. Each little bag was filled
with candy. Apples and gilded nuts were hung on it. They looked as
if they were growing upon the tree. Dolls that looked just like real
babies were laid under the lowest branches. Hundreds of red, white and
blue tapers were fastened on the tree. At the very top was a beautiful
golden star.</p>

<p>&#8220;How pretty it looks!&#8221; said the young ladies. &#8220;How
bright it will look to-night!&#8221; &#8220;How I wish that the
night were come and the tapers lighted,&#8221; thought the tree.
&#8220;I wonder if the sparrows will peep in at the windows and see
me!&#8221;</p>

<p>At last night came. How beautiful the tree looked with all its
tapers twinkling like tiny stars among its dark green leaves. All at
once the door was opened. In rushed a troop of merry children. How
they shouted and clapped their hands for joy<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> when they saw the
beautiful tree. Then, hand in hand, they danced around it, singing a
sweet Christmas song.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; said the fir tree, &#8220;at last I am
happy.&#8221;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
